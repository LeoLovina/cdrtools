NEW features of cdrecord-1.9:

We are now only a few releases away from the final libscg that includes
SCSI low level command transport.

Late changes:

-	New Media manufacturer: "Grand Advance Technology LTD."

-	Readcd.c now correctly initializes the filename in write (-w) mode.

-	Mkisofs: apple_driver.c small bug fix from James.

All:

-	Fallback code to use the USCSI interface on Solaris
	This should add ATAPI support on Solaris 8 sparc.
	Solaris 8 x86 does support ATAPI with the scg driver
	as Sun fixed the structural bug for thw Intel version.

	Warning: The USCI interface has several drawbacks:

	-	Only finds disk type devices with -scanbus

	-	Cannot open devices that are currently attached
		to the volume management system

	-	The Goldstar ATAPI CD-ROM in a U-10 transfers data
		but the DMA residual count shows that there has
		been no transfer at all.

	Facit: Test by your own if this interface is usable.
	Please report problems!

	To check the difference:

	cdrecord -scanbus 		uses the scg driver
	cdrecord -scanbus dev=USCSI	uses the USCSI interface
	cdrecord -toc	 dev=1,6,0	uses the scg driver
	cdrecord -toc	dev=USCSI:1,6,0	uses the USCSI interface

	NOTE: If you are using the USCSI interface you will need 
		to shut down the volume management for the drives
		you like to use.

-	Linux code in libscg now tries to use new features of the
	Linus sg driver:

	-	Trying to use more then 32 kB for DMA
		The interface for raising the DMA limit from 32 kB
		is a real pain. It needs a lot of code to adopt
		the interface to libscg.

	-	Trying to use the new ioctl() interface if present.
		This interface now supports:

		-	SCSI CDB sizes for vendor unique commands

		-	SCSI status byte

		-	SCSI command transport status

		-	More than 16 bytes of sense data
			(not yet working!)

		-	DMA residual count
			(not yet working!)

		-	Arbitrary DMA address pointers !!!

	-	Trying to use the new RESET ioctl()
		(not yet working!)

	All items marked (not yet working!) will turn funtional
	after the Linux kernel starts to support them.

	It seems that my shouting for a better SCSI interface succeeded.
	Linux-2.4 supports or at least includes an interface that may support
	the needed things in future.

	As from now it is unclear whether the code will expose
	any portability problems, please test on different Linux
	versions from 2.0 ... 2.4 if available and report problems.


-	README.macosX added (needed to know how to compile).
	As Apple deliveres an inconsistent OS, you need to follow the
	instuctions in this README file before you may compile
	cdrtools on Mac OS X.

TODO:

-	Better BeOS integration

Cdrecord:

-	include sys/select.h if needed (AIX)

-	Support for Ricoh 9060 CD-RW/DVD-ROM drive

-	Support for Plextor PX-W1210TA (with BURN-Proof)

-	Printing of new features added to -prcap function

-	New Disk manufacturers:

		"WEALTH FAIR INVESTMENT LIMITE"
		"General Magnetics Ld"
		"MPO"

-	DAO now should work with pregapsize == 0 when
	using Sony or Goldstar drives.

	Cdrecord retries with pregaps set to 1

-	New options -shorttrack & -noshorttrack
	will allow to copy CD's with supershort tracks
	in DAO mode if the drive supports it.

-	Fix for a buffer overflow with cdrecord dev=
	This problem did not exist on sparc systems,
	for this reason it has not been detected before.

-	ATIP Decoder now decodes disk sub type for High speed CD-RW

-	Support for 99 minute CD's.

-	Force the user to use -ignsize to allow >= 90 Minutes on CD even
	when the current CD is not in the blank capacity database.

Cdda2wav:

-	support for cds with illegal leadout (like HIM-CD)

-	bugfix for cd-text detection with plextor/Sony command sets

-	should compile and run under Mac-OS-X now

-	bugfix with the -q (quiet) option

-	bugfix use extra libs (like lossaudio for NetBSD)

-	bugfix use the correct sound device for Solaris

-	hardened cdda2wav against illegal ISRC codes

-	more diagnostics for illegal ISRCs

-	use setpriority in favor of nice

-	updated cdda2mp3 script for lame usage (alpha)

Readcd:

-	minor bugfixes with timing

-	New options -noerror & retries=#

-	restructured to be more flexible

-	Support for C2 error pointer scan with MMC drives & 
	the Plextor U-Plex 40 CD-ROM


Mkisofs:

-	Now mkhybrid code is completely integrated into mkisofs.	
	There is only one binary. To help users of mkhybrid, 
	make install creates a hard link from mkhybroid to mkisofs.

-	man page cleaned up.

-	Now mkhybrid code is completely integrated into mkisofs.	
	There is only one binary. To help users of mkhybrid, 
	make install creates a hard link from mkhybroid to mkisofs.

-	New Option -eltorito-alt-boot allows to specify more
	than one Al Torito boot image (up to 63).
	Thanks to Egor Duda (deo@logos-m.ru).

-	fixed a core dump problem in multi.c

-	write.c now uses static buffer to circumvent a problem
	with the stone age Metrowerks C found on BeOS/PPC

-	Allow printing of percentage ready without floatingpoint code
	in printf.

-	apple_driver now compiles, but need to call 
	make -f apple_driver.mk 
	by hand

-	graft pointers are now really usable:

	-	Graft points are now disabled by default

	-	To enable, specify the -graft-point option

		dir=dir only works if the '=' is not escaped by '\'
		'\\' and '=' must be escaped by a '\\' if
		-graft-points has been specified.

-	Now there is no more a need to specify a command line arg
	if -path-list has been specified.

TODO:
	-	better Rock Rodge recognition for multi-session

	-	read Joliet filenames with multi-session if no TRANS.TBL
		or RR is present. I am looking for a volouteer for this task:
		Peter Berendi <berendi2@webdesign.hu> announced that he likes
		to be the volounteer for this task.

	-	implement Yellow book compliant XA extended dir attributes

	-	add libecc/edc for CDI and similar.

	-	add UDF support

CYGWIN NT-4.0 NOTES:

To compile on Cygwin32, get Cygwin32-beta20 and install it.
then create a symlink from /bin to the .../bin directory where bash is located.
Now run 'make' ...
For more information read README.win32

The files are located on:

ftp://ftp.fokus.gmd.de/pub/unix/cdrecord/alpha ...

NOTE:	These tar archives are 100% ansi compatible. Solaris 2.x tar and GNU
	tar may get some minor trouble.

WARNING: Do not use 'mc' to extract the tar file!
	All mc versions before 4.0.14 cannot extract symbolic links correctly.

WARNING: Do not use 'winzip' to extract the tar file!
	Winzip cannot extract symbolic links correctly.
