Subject: cdrecord 1.4 has been released

Cdrecord 1.4 has been released.

Cdrecord allows you to create CD's on a CD-Recorder.
Cdrecord runs on:

SunOS 4.1.3 or later:	sparc.
Solaris 2.3 or later:	sparc and x86.
Linux:			x86, sparc and alpha.

NEW features of cdrecord-1.4:

	- Ful multi session support

	- Mkisofs-1.11 included to allow Solaris users to read the
	  old session from the CD-R device by using the scsi library.
	  Needed for multi-session.

	- Philips CDD-2600 & HP-6020i now fully supported

	- Sony CDU-924 supported

	- Ricoh RO-1420S supported

	- Plasmon RF-4100 supported

	- New drive abstraction layer

	- SCSI-3 conforming error messages

Coming soon:
	Sformat (see below)

I am interested to see cdrecord ported to SGI, HU-UX and FreeBSD.

I am interested to hear if someone is interested in a kernel based
filesystem for Solaris that uses packet writing on the CD-Recorder.
The filesystem will create a single session CD that may be finally converted
to a hybrid filesystem that allows to be read as 
ISO-9660 with Rock Ridge extensions too.
Please mail suggestions to: wofs@schily.isdn.cs.tu-berlin.de

The cdrecord distribution contains a SCSI user level transport library.
The SCSI library is suitable to talk to any SCSI device without having
a special driver for it.
Cdrecord may be easily ported to any system that has a 
SCSI device driver similar to the scg driver.

The SCSI transport library has been taken from the sformat program.
Sformat is the first SCSI disk formatting/analyzing/repairing that runs on
SunOS/Solaris. The first release of sformat has been made for SunOS 3.0 in 1986
(two years before Sun introduced their format utility). Sformat will be 
available in source within the next few months.

Solaris/SunOS only:
You *need* the SCSI general driver 'scg' in order to run cdrecord.
It is supplied binary in pkgadd(1m) format and is tested 
on Solaris 2.3, Solaris 2.4 & Solaris 2.5 (sparc).

Solaris only:
It is _nice to have_ the 'fbk' driver to mount files that contain 
images of file systems. Fbk means File simulates Block Device.
It is supplied binary in pkgadd(1m) format and is tested
on Solaris 2.3, Solaris 2.4 & Solaris 2.5 (sparc).

cdrecord compiles and runs on Solaris x86, thanks to 
gert@fwi.uva.nl (Gert Poletiek) who did the tests.
The bitorder problems have been eliminated.

There may be some performance problems on Solaris x86.
A possible solution is to reduce BUF_SIZE to 32 kBytes.
It may be that the real reason is that the PC-architecture
has no IO-MMU and therefore is not able to do DVMA.
If this points out to be the reason, I have to
change the scg driver & cdrecord, but this would 
be needed on Linux anyway.

cdrecord should compile on SunOS, but you will need the scg driver for
SunOS in this case.

Cdrecord has been implemented with a Philips CDD 521.
Cdrecord now is maintained with a Philips CDD-2000
It should run also on:

	Philips CDD 522
	Philips CDD 2000
	Philips CDD 2600
	HP C4324/C4325	 (HP SureStore 4020i/6020i)
	Plasmon	RF-41000
	Plasmon CDR 4220 (not tested)
	Grundig CDR-100  (not tested)
	Mitsumi	CR-2401-TS (not tested)
	Yamaha	CDR-100
	Yamaha	CDR-102
	Sony	CDU-924

Multi-session has not been tested with the Plasmon RF-4100

All companies that support me with SCSI command reference manuals and drives
will get (continued) support in the following releases.

To install get:

	SCHILYscg.sparc.tar.Z	The scg driver in pkgadd format (sparc).
	SCHILYfbk.sparc.tar.Z	The fbk driver in pkgadd format (sparc).
	SCHILYscg.i386.tar.Z	The scg driver in pkgadd format (x86).
	SCHILYfbk.i386.tar.Z	The fbk driver in pkgadd format (x86).
	cdrecord-1.1.tar.Z	The cdrecord for Solaris distribution.

NOTE:	These tar archives are 100% ansi compatible. Solaris 2.x tar and GNU
	tar may get some minor trouble.

The files are located on:

ftp://ftp.fokus.gmd.de/pub/unix/cdrecord/ ...
ftp://ftp.fokus.gmd.de/pub/unix/kernel/scg/ ...
ftp://ftp.fokus.gmd.de/pub/unix/kernel/fbk/ ...

The cdrecord distribution contains a SCSI user level transport library.
The SCSI library is suitable to talk to any SCSI device without having
a special driver for it.

If you need mkisofs, it is located on:

ftp://ftp.fokus.gmd.de/pub/unix/cdrecord/mkisofs-1.11.tar.gz

but it is also contained in cdrecord-1.4
