This release of cdrecord includes support for mkisofs.

**** Do NOT run configure in the directory mkisofs-1.11 ****

I changed the make system to use my make file system.

Read the file README.multi to learn how to create multi-session
CD-R's with this release of cdrecord and mkisofs.

You definitely need this patched release of mkisofs-1.11 to 
create multi-session CD-R's on SunOS.
