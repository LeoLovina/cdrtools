Subject: cdrecord 1.6 has been released
Keywords: CD-R CD-RW CDRecord CDwrite SunOS Solaris Linux SGI IRIX FreeBSD NetBSD OpenBSD HP-UX

This is Version 1.6 of cdrecord

Cdrecord allows you to create CD's on a CD-Recorder.
Cdrecord runs on:

SunOS 4.1.3 or later:	sparc.
Solaris 2.3 or later:	sparc and x86.
Linux:			x86 sparc alpha and ppc.
NetBSD/FreeBSD/OpenBSD:	x86 sparc
SGI IRIX:		mips
HP-UX:			hppa
AIX:			rs6000

NEW features of cdrecord-1.6 (shortened):

-	Added FIFO (ring buffer) code as a mixture from the fifo code
	from star and a proposal from Finn Arne Gangstad <finnag@guardian.no>
	This allows to use even NFS mounted disk images.
-	CD blank manufacturer decoder that reads information from ATIP
	(not all drives allow you to do a read ATIP)
-	Check the available space on the media
-	Drive support enhanced for a lot of new more drives.
-	ATAPI support
-	AIX supppot
-	Apple Rhapsody support (no source included)
-	Support for .wav and .au files
-	Better SCSI error printing
-	Use real time scheduler on Linux and HP-UX too.
-	Use mlockall() on Linux too.

I am interested to hear if someone is interested in a kernel based
filesystem for Solaris that uses packet writing on the CD-Recorder.
The filesystem will create a single session CD that may be finally converted
to a hybrid filesystem that allows to be read as 
ISO-9660 with Rock Ridge extensions too.
Please mail suggestions to: wofs@schily.isdn.cs.tu-berlin.de

The cdrecord distribution contains a SCSI user level transport library.
The SCSI library is suitable to talk to any SCSI device without having
a special driver for it.
Cdrecord may be easily ported to any system that has a 
SCSI device driver similar to the scg driver.

The SCSI transport library has been taken from the sformat program.
Sformat is the first SCSI disk formatting/analyzing/repairing that runs on
SunOS/Solaris. The first release of sformat has been made for SunOS 3.0 in 1986
(two years before Sun introduced their format utility). Sformat source
including 12 years of competence in SCSI disk handling is available
on:
	ftp://ftp.fokus.gmd.de/pub/unix/sformat

On SunOS/Solaris:
You *need* the SCSI general driver 'scg' in order to run cdrecord.

SunOS 4.1.3 only:
The 'scg' driver is Copyright 1986-1995 Jörg Schilling,
it is supplied binary in a loadable format.
There is no future support, there is no non loadable support.

Solaris only:
The 'scg' driver is Copyright 1986-1995 Jörg Schilling,
it is supplied binary in pkgadd(1m) format and is tested 
on Solaris 2.3, Solaris 2.4 & Solaris 2.5 (sparc).

Solaris only:
It is _nice to have_ the 'fbk' driver to mount files that contain 
images of file systems. Fbk means File simulates Block Device.
It is supplied binary in pkgadd(1m) format and is tested
on Solaris 2.3, Solaris 2.4 & Solaris 2.5 (sparc).

cdrecord compiles on SunOS, but you will need a specific scg driver for
SunOS in this case.

Cdrecord has been implemented with a Philips CDD 521.
Cdrecord now is maintained with the following drives:

	COMPRO/Matsushita/Panasonic CW-7502
	Philips CDD-2000
	TEAC CD-R55S
	Yamaha CDR-400

All companies that support me with SCSI command reference manuals and drives
will get (continued) support in the following releases.

The following drives will never be supported by cdrecord because they are too old:

	JVC XR-W1001
	Pinnacle Micro RCD-202
	Ricoh RS-9200CD

The following dries are curently not supported because I don't get specs:
(some of them may partially work: see above)

	Sony CDU-928E does not work, it violates the ATAPI specs
	Sony CDW-900E
	

All companies that support me with SCSI command reference manuals and drives
will get (continued) support in the following releases.

To install get:

	cdrecord-1.6.tar.gz	The cdrecord distribution.

	Solaris only:

	SCHILYscg.sparc.tar.Z	The scg driver in pkgadd format (sparc).
	SCHILYfbk.sparc.tar.Z	The fbk driver in pkgadd format (sparc).
	SCHILYscg.i386.tar.Z	The scg driver in pkgadd format (x86).
	SCHILYfbk.i386.tar.Z	The fbk driver in pkgadd format (x86).

NOTE:	These tar archives are 100% ansi compatible. Solaris 2.x tar and GNU
	tar may get some minor trouble.

WARNING: Do not use 'mc' to extract the tar file!
	All mc versions before 4.0.14 cannot extract symbolic links correctly.

The files are located on:

The cdrecord distribution contains a SCSI user level transport library.
The SCSI library is suitable to talk to any SCSI device without having
a special driver for it.

If you need mkisofs, it is located on:

ftp://ftp.fokus.gmd.de/pub/unix/cdrecord/mkisofs-1.11.tar.gz

but it is also contained in cdrecord-1.6
