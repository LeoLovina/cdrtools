.TH CDRECORD 1 "Version 1.5" "J\*org Schilling" "Schily\'s USER COMMANDS"
.SH NAME
cdrecord \- record audio or data Compact Discs from a master
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cdrecord
[
.I "general options
]
.BI dev= device
[
.I track options
]
.IR track1 .\|.\|. trackn

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Cdrecord
is used to record data or audio Compact Discs on an Orange Book
CD-Recorder.
.PP
The
.I device
refers to
.IR scsibus / target / lun
of the CD-Recorder. Communication on 
.I SunOS
is done with the SCSI general driver
.B scg.
Other operating systems are using a library simulation of this driver.
Possible syntax is:
.B dev=
.IR scsibus , target , lun
or
.B dev=
.IR target , lun .
In the latter case, the CD-Recorder has to be connected to the default 
SCSI bus of the machine.
.PP
.IR Scsibus ,
.I target 
and 
.I lun
are integer numbers. 
To make 
.B cdrecord
portable to all \s-2UNIX\s0 platforms, there is no way to specify a real
device file name.
.I Scsibus 
0 is the default SCSI bus on the machine. Watch the boot messages for more 
information or look into 
.B /var/adm/messages 
for more information about the SCSI configuration of your machine.
.PP
Each
.I track
corresponds to a single file that contains the prepared data for that track.
If the argument is 
.RB ` \- ',
standard input is used for that track. 
There may only be one track that is taken from 
.IR stdin .

.SH "GENERAL OPTIONS
.PP
General options must be before any track file name or track option.
.TP
.B \-version
Print version information and exit.
.TP
.B \-v
Be verbose during work, display the progress of the writing process.
.TP
.B \-V
Be verbose in respect of SCSI command transport. This helps to debug problems
during the writing process, that occur in the CD-Recorder. 
If you get incomprehensible error messages you should use this flag
to get more detailed output.
Using
.B \-V
slows down the process and may be the reason for a buffer underrun.
.TP
.B \-debug
Print additional debug messages. This may help to find out problems
with sector sizes and sector types.
Using
.B \-debug
slows down the process and may be the reason for a buffer underrun.
.TP
.B \-dummy
The CD-Recorder will go through all steps of the recording process,
but the laser is turned off during this procedure.
It is recommended to run several tests before actually writing to a 
Compact Disk, if the timing and load response of the system is not known.
.TP
.B \-multi
Allow multi session CD's to be made. This flag needs to be present
on all sessions of a multi session disk,
except you want to create a session that will be 
the last session on the media.
The fixation will be done in a way that allows the CD-Recorder to
append additional sessions later. This is done by generation a TOC
with a link to the next program area. The so generated media is not
100%  compatible to manufactured CD's. 
Use only for recording a multi session CD.
If this option is present, the default track type is
.BR "CD-ROM XA mode 2" .
The 
.I Sony 
drives have no hardware support for 
.BR "CD-ROM XA mode 2" .
You have tp specify the 
.B \-data 
option in order to create multi session disks on these drives.
.TP
.B \-msinfo
Retrieve multi session info in a form suitable for 
.B "mkisofs-1.10" 
or later.
.TP
.B \-toc
Retrieve and print out the table of content or PMA of a CD.
With this option, 
.B cdrecord
will work also with a CD-Rom drive.
.TP
.B \-fix
The disk will only be fixated (i.e. a TOC for a CD-Reader will be written). 
This may be used, if for some reason the disk has been written but not
fixated.
.TP
.B \-nofix
Do not fixate the disk after writing the tracks. This may be used
to create an audio disk in steps. An unfixated disk can usually not be used
on a non CD-writer type drive but there are audio CD players that will
be able to play such a disk.
.TP
.B \-eject
Eject disk after doing the work.
Some Devices (e.g. Philips) need to eject the medium before creating a new
disk. Doing a \-dummy test and immediately creating a real disk would not
work on these devices.
.TP
.B "speed=#
Set the speed factor of the writing process to #.
# is an integer, representing a multiple of the audio speed.
This is about 150 KB/s for CD-ROM and about 172 KB/s for CD-Audio.
If no 
.I speed
option is present, 
.B cdrecord
will try to get the speed value from the 
.B CDR_SPEED
environment.
If your drive has problems with
.I "speed=2 
or 
.IR "speed=4" , 
you should try 
.IR "speed=0" .
.TP
.BI dev= target
Sets the SCSI target for the CD-Recorder, see notes above.
If no 
.I dev
option is present, 
.B cdrecord
will try to get the device from the 
.B CDR_DEVICE
environment.
.TP
.BI driver= name
Allows to use a user supplied driver name for the device.
To get a list of possible drivers use
.BR "driver=help" .
The reason for the existence of this option is to allow users to use 
.B cdrecord
with drives that are similar to supported drives but not known
directly by
.BR cdrecord .
Use this option with extreme care. If a wrong driver is used for a
device, the possibility of creating corrupted disks is high.
The minimum problem related to a wrong driver is that the 
.B \-speed
or 
.B \-dummy
will not work.
.TP
.B \-checkdrive
Checks if a driver for the current drive is present and exit.
If the drive is a known drive, 
.B cdrecord
uses exit code 0.
.TP
.B \-inq
Do an inquiry for the drive, print the inquiry info and exit.
.TP
.B \-scanbus
Scan all SCSI devices on all SCSI busses and print the inquiry
strings. This option may be used to find SCSI address of the 
CD-Recorder on a system.

.SH "TRACK OPTIONS
.PP
Track options may be mixed with track file names.
.TP
.B \-audio
If this flag is present, all subsequent tracks are written in
.B "CD-DA 
(similar to Red Book) audio format.
The file with data for this tracks should
contain stereo, 16-bit digital audio with 44100 samples/s.
The byte order should be the following: MSB left, LSB left, 
MSB right, LSB right, MSB left and so on. The track should be a multiple of 
2352 bytes. It is not possible to put the master image of an audio track 
on a raw disk because 
data will be read in multiple of 2352 bytes during the recording process.
The audio data stream must not have any headers. Using audio data formats
with headers as input to 
.B cdrecord
will usually work if the structure of the data is the structure described
above but you will hear a click at the start of a track.
.TP
.B \-swab
If this flag is present, swapped audio data may be used for writing to CD.
Some types of CD-Writers e.g. Yamaha, Sony and the
new SCSI-3/mmc drives are using the wrong byte order for audio data,
ignoring the fact that the SCSI-protocol otherwise correctly
uses network (big endian) byte order. 
.B Cdrecord
knows if a CD-Recorder needs byte swapping and corrects the byte order
of the data stream to the byte order described with the 
.I \-audio 
flag.
You only need the 
.I \-swab 
flag if your data stream is in Intel byte order. Note that the verbose
output of
.B cdrecord
instead will not show you if the 
.I \-swab 
flag was present for a track.
.B Cdrecord
shows you if it really needs to swab that track.
.TP
.B \-data
If this flag is present, all subsequent tracks are written in
.B "CD-ROM mode 1
(Yellow Book) format. The data is a multiple of 2048 bytes.
The file with track data should contain an 
.BR ISO-9660 " or " "Rock Ridge
filesystem image (see 
.B mkisofs
for more details). If the track data is an
.B ufs
filesystem image, fragment size should be set to 2 KB or more to allow
CR-drives with 2 KB sector size to to be used for reading.
.TP
.I " "
\-data is the default, if no other flag is present.
.TP
.B \-mode2
If this flag is present, all subsequent tracks are written in
.B "CD-ROM mode 2
format. The data is a multiple of 2048 bytes.
.TP
.B \-xa1
If this flag is present, all subsequent tracks are written in
.B "CD-ROM XA mode 1
format. The data is a multiple of 2048 bytes.
.TP
.B \-xa2
If this flag is present, all subsequent tracks are written in
.B "CD-ROM XA mode 2
format. The data is a multiple of 2048 bytes.
.TP
.B \-cdi
If this flag is present, all subsequent tracks are written in
.B "CDI
format. The data is a multiple of 2048 bytes.
.TP
.B \-isosize
Use the 
.B "ISO-9660
file system size as the size of the next track.
This option is needed if you want to read the image of a track from
a raw disk partition or on a master CD. In the first case the option
.B \-isosize
is needed to limit the size of the CD to the size of the iso filesystem.
In the second case the option
.B \-isosize
is needed to prevent 
.B cdrecord
from reading the two run out blocks that are appended by each CD-recorder
in track at once mode. These two run out blocks cannot be read and would
cause a buffer underrun that would cause e defective copy.
Do not use this option if 
.B cdrecord
reads the track data from 
.IR stdin .
This option currently cannot be used to determine the size of a file system
if the multi session option is present.
.TP
.B \-pad
If the track is a data track, 15 sectors of zeroed data
will be added to the end of this and each subsequent data track.
Use this option if your CD-drive is not able to read the last sectors of
a track or if you want to read to be able to read the CD
on a 
.B Linux 
system with the iso9660 filesystem read ahead bug.
If the 
.I \-pad 
option refers to an audio track,
.B cdrecord 
will pad the audio data to be a multiple of 2352 bytes. 
The audio data padding is done with binary zeroes which is 
equal to absolute silence.
.TP
.B \-nopad
Do not pad the following tracks \- the default.
.TP
.B \-preemp
If this flag is present, all TOC entries for subsequent audio tracks 
will indicate that the audio data has been sampled with 50/15 µsec
preemphasis.
The data, however is not modified during the process of transferring from file
to disk. 
This option has no effect on data tracks.
.TP
.B \-nopreemp
If this flag is present, all TOC entries for subsequent audio tracks 
will indicate that the audio data has been mastered with linear data \- 
this is the default.
.TP
.B bytes=#
If the master image for the next track has been stored on a raw disk, 
use this option
to specify the valid amount of data on this disk. If the image of the next 
track is stored in a regular file, the size of that file is taken to determine
the length of this track.
If the track contains an ISO 9660 filesystem image use the 
.I \-isosize
option to determine the length of that filesystem image.

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
For all examples below, it will be assumed that the CD-Recorder is
connected to the primary SCSI bus of the machine. The SCSI target id is
set to 2.
.PP
To record a pure CD-ROM at double speed, using data from the file
.IR cdimage.raw :
.PP
    cdrecord \-v speed=2 dev=2,0 cdimage.raw
.PP
To create an image for a ISO 9660 filesystem with Rock Ridge extensions:
.PP
    mkisofs \-R \-o cdimage.raw /home/joerg/master/tree
.PP
To check the resulting file before writing to CD on Solaris:
.PP
    mount \-r \-F fbk \-o type=hsfs /dev/fbk0:cdimage.raw /mnt
.PP
On Linux:
.PP
    mount cdimage.raw \-r \-t iso9660 \-o loop /mnt
.PP
Go on with:
.br
    ls \-lR /mnt
.br
    umount /mnt
.PP
If the overall speed of the system is sufficient and the structure of
the filesystem is not too complex, cdrecord will run without creating an
image of the ISO 9660 filesystem. Simply run the pipeline:
.PP
    mkisofs \-R /master/tree | cdrecord \-v speed=2 dev=2,0 -
.PP
If your system is loaded, you should run mkisofs in the real time class too.
To raise the priority of 
.B mkisofs
replace the command
.PP
    mkisofs \-R /master/tree
.br
by
.br
    priocntl \-e \-c RT \-p 59 mkisofs \-R /master/tree
.sp
on Solaris and by
.sp
    nice -18 mkisofs \-R /master/tree
.sp
on SunOS.
.PP
Cdrecord runs at priority 59 on Solaris, you should run mkisofs
at no more than priority 58. On SunOS, you should run mkisofs
at no less than nice -18.
.PP
Creating a CD-ROM without file system image on disk has been tested
on a Sparcstation-2 with a Yamaha CDR-100. It did work up to double speed.
A faster machine may be able to handle quad speed also.
.PP
To record a pure CD-DA (audio) at single speed, with each track contained
in a file named
.IR track01.cdaudio ,
.IR track02.cdaudio ,
etc:
.PP
    cdrecord \-v speed=1 dev=2,0 -audio track*.cdaudio
.PP
To check if it will be ok to use double speed for the example above. 
Use the dummy write option:
.PP
    cdrecord \-v \-dummy speed=2 dev=2,0 \-audio track*.cdaudio
.PP
To record a mixed-mode CD with an ISO 9660 filesystem from
.I cdimage.raw
on the first track, the other tracks being audio tracks from the files
.IR track01.cdaudio ,
.IR track02.cdaudio ,
etc:
.PP
    cdrecord \-v \-dummy dev=2,0 cdimage.raw \-audio track*.cdaudio

.BR mkisofs (1),
.BR scg (7),
.BR fbk (7).

.SH NOTES
The current version of
.B cdrecord
will only record
.B "track at once
Discs.
If the so made disks contain more than one track,
they are not suitable for direct mass production by CD manufacturers.
You will need the 
.B "disk at once
option to record such disks.
Nevertheless the disks made with
.B cdrecord
will normally be read in all CD players. Some old
audio CD players however may produce a two second click between two audio tracks.
.PP
The minimal size of a track is 4 seconds or 300 sectors. If you write 
smaller tracks, the CD-Recorder will add dummy blocks. This is not an
error, even though the SCSI-error message looks this way.
.PP
.B Cdrecord
has been tested on an upgraded Philips CDD-521 recorder at single and 
double speed on a SparcStation 20/502 with no problems, slower computer systems
should work also. 
The newer Philips/HP/Plasmon/Grundig
drives as well as Yamaha CDR-100 and CDR-102 work also. The Plasmon RF-4100
work, but has not tested in multi session.
A Philips CDD-521 that has not been upgraded will not work.
The Sony CDU-924 has been tested, but does not support XA-mode2 in hardware.
The sony therefore cannot create conforming multi session disks.
The Ricoh RO-1420C works, but some people seem to have problems to 
use them with speed=2, try speed=0 in this case.
.PP
The Yamaha CDR-400 and all new SCSI-3/mmc conforming drives are supported
in single and multi-session.
CD-RW drives like the Ricoh MP-6200 are currently supported as CD-R drives only.
Erasing the disk or parts of the disk will be added in a later version of cdrecord.
.PP
You should run several tests in all supported speeds of your drive with the
.B \-dummy
option turned on if you are using 
.B cdrecord
on an unknown system. Writing a CD is a realtime process. 
You can currently not use cdimages that are located on
.B NFS
file systems.
.B NFS
will not deliver constantly the needed data rates.
I used
.B cdrecord 
with with medium load on a SS20/502 and even at quad speed 
on a Sparcstation-2 which was heavily loaded, 
but it is recommended to leave the system
as lightly loaded as possible while writing a CD.
.B Cdrecord
needs to run as root to get access to the 
.B /dev/scg?
device nodes and to be able to lock itself into memory.
.PP
If you don't want to allow users to become root on your system,
.B cdrecord
may safely be installed suid root. This allows all users or a group of
users with no root privileges to use 
.B cdrecord.
.B Cdrecord 
in this case checks, if the real user would have been able to read 
the specified files.
To give all user access to use 
.B cdrecord, 
enter:
.PP
	chmod 4711 /usr/local/bin/cdrecord
.PP
To give a restricted group of users access to cdrecord enter:
.PP
	chmod 4710 /usr/local/bin/cdrecord
.br
	chgrp cdburners /usr/local/bin/cdrecord
.PP
and add a group 
.I cdburners
on your system.
.PP
Never give write permissions for non root users to the 
.I /dev/scg?
devices unless you would allow anybody to read/write/format
all your disks.
.PP
You should not connect old drives that do not support
disconnect/reconnect to either the SCSI bus that is connected to the
CD-Recorder or the source disk.
.PP
A Compact Disc can have no more than 99 tracks.
.PP
When creating a disc with both audio and data tracks, 
the data should be on track 1 otherwise wou should create
a CDplus disk which is a multi session disk with the first session 
containing the audio tracks and the following session containing the data track.
.PP
Many operating systems are not able to read more than a single data track, or
need special software to do so.
.PP
More information on the SCSI command set of a HP CD-Recorder can be found at:
.PP
	http://www.hp.com/isgsupport/cdr/index.html
.PP
If you have more information or SCSI command manuals for other CD-Recorders
than Philips CDD 522 or the HP drive mentioned above please contact the author.
.PP
The Philips CDD 521 CD-Recorder (even in the upgraded version)
has several firmware bugs. Some of them will
force you to power cycle the device or to reboot the machine.
.PP
When using 
.B cdrecord
with the broken 
.B "Linux SCSI generic driver."
You should note that 
.B cdrecord
uses a hack, that tries to emulate the functionality of the scg driver.
Unfortunately, the sg driver on 
.B Linux
has several severe bugs:
.TP
\(bu
It cannot see if SCSI command could not be sent at all.
.TP
\(bu
It cannot get the SCSI status byte. 
.B Cdrecord
for that reason cannot report failing SCSI commands in some
situations.
.TP
\(bu
It cannot get real dma count of transfer. 
.B Cdrecord
cannot tell you if there is an dma residual count.
.TP
\(bu
It cannot get number of bytes valid in auto sense data.
.B Cdrecord
cannot tell you if device transfers no sense data at all.
.TP
\(bu
It fetches to few data in auto request sense (CCS/SCSI-2/SCSI-3 needs >= 18).

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.PP
You have 9 seconds to type ^C to abort 
.B cdrecord
after you see the message:
.PP
Starting to write CD at speed %d in %s mode for %s session.
.PP
A typical error message for a SCSI command looks like:
.sp
.RS
.nf
cdrecord: I/O error. test unit ready: scsi sendcmd: no error
status: 0x2 (CHECK CONDITION)
Sense Bytes: 70 00 05 00 00 00 00 0A 00 00 00 00 25 00 00 00 00 00
Sense Key: 0x5 Illegal Request, Segment 0
Sense Code: 0x25 Qual 0x00 (logical unit not supported) Fru 0x0
Sense flags: Blk 0 (not valid)
.fi
.sp
.RE
The first line gives information about the transport of the command.
The text after the first colon gives the error text for the system call
from the view of the kernel. It usually is:
.B "I/O error
unless other problems happen. The next words contain a short description for
the SCSI command that fails. The rest of the line tells you if there were
any problems for the transport of the command over the SCSI bus.
.B "fatal error
means that it was not possible to transport the command (i.e. no device present
at the requested SCSI address).
.PP
The second line gives information on the SCSI status code returned by the 
command, if the transport of the command succeeds. 
This is error information from the SCSI device.
.PP
The third line is a hex dump of the auto request sense information for the 
command.
.PP
The fourth line is the error text for the sense key if available, followed
by the segment number that is only valid if the command was a
.I copy
command. If the error message is not directly related to the current command,
the text
.I deferred error
is appended.
.PP
The fifth line is the error text for the sense code and the sense qualifier if available.
If the type of the device is known, the sense data is decoded from tables
in
.IR scsierrs.c " .
The text is followed by the error value for a field replaceable unit.
.PP
The sixth line prints the block number that is related to the failed command
and text for several error flags. The block number may not be valid.
.PP
The following message is not an error:
..sp
.RS
.nf
Track 01: Total bytes read/written: 2048/2048 (1 sectors).
cdrecord: I/O error. flush cache: scsi sendcmd: no error
status: 0x2 (CHECK CONDITION)
Sense Bytes: F0 00 05 80 00 00 27 0A 00 00 00 00 B5 00 00 00 00 00
Sense Key: 0x5 Illegal Request, Segment 0
Sense Code: 0xB5 Qual 0x00 (dummy data blocks added) Fru 0x0
Sense flags: Blk -2147483609 (valid)
.fi
.sp
.RE
It simply notifies, that a track that is smaller than the minimum size has been
expanded to 300 sectors.
.SH BUGS
.PP
.B Cdrecord
should verify that the input data will fit on the media. Currently you get
unpredictable results in this case.
.PP
There should be an option to write index numbers for audio tracks.
.PP
There should be a recover option to make disks usable, that have been written
during a power failure.
