A first release of cdrecord has been released for *BSD.

*BSD has a userland SCSI ioctl(2) that is very similar to my /dev/scg* design
that I made in 1986 for SunOS/Solaris. Unfortunately every other line of code
seems to try to keep me away from using this code. See hints below
for using cdrecord on *BSD systems.

I would be happy to get test reports ...

Hints for installing/testing:

Read the README.xxxBSD file in the disribution.

If /dev/su0-0-0 ... do not work on your system, you may try
use dev=/dev/rcd0a:@,0 od dev=/dev/rcd0a:@
If the CD-Recorder is on /dev/cd0a

Read the man page for more information.

You may also try to use /dev/cd0c:@  /dev/cd0d or /dev/cd0.ctl:@
*BSD seems not to be well tested with user level SCSI commands.

This changes with FreeBSD/cam

You then will be able to access the CD-Recorder as on other
systems. If your CD-Recorder is on SCSI Bus 0, Target 2, lun 0
type:

cdrecord dev=0,2,0 .....

cdrecord -scanbus also works on FreeBSD/cam

I hope to get cdrecord work better with your help soon.
