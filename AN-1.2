Subject: cdrecord 1.2 & SCSI general library have been released


Cdrecord 1.2 has been released.

Cdrecord allows you to create CD's on a CD-Recorder.
Cdrecord runs on sparc and x86 on Solaris 2.3 or later.

NEW features of cdrecord-1.2:

	- Added -swab option to support Yamaha audio
	  Thanks to (Fred) ecoven@montefiore.ulg.ac.be
	  for the hint.
	- Added counter for quit time (9 seconds)
	- Flush cache & Fixation with separate bigger timeout,
	   other timeout reduced to 20sec.
	- Set sector size on all drive types before writing,
	- Ommit the write_track_info Mode Select before write_track
	  even for Philips drives (this is currently not needed because
	  we don't support ISRC codes at this time).
	- New error codes for CDD-2000 & error code support for Yamaha CDR-100
	- scsireset() aded to scsitransport.[hc]
	- Timings for Track and Fixation

Comming soon:
	Sformat (see below)
	Support for multi-session including a new multi-session filesystem
	SUPSPENDED: prototype program (to replace mkisofs).
	currently waiting for mkisofs-1.06 with multi-session support

I am interested to hear if someone is interested in a kernel based
filesystem for Solaris that uses packet writing on the CD-Recorder.
The filesystem will create a single session CD that may be finally converted
to a hybride filesystem that alllows to be read as 
ISO-9660 with Rock Ridge extensions too.
Please mail suggestions to: wofs@schily.isdn.cs.tu-berlin.de

The cdrecord distribution contains a SCSI user level transport library.
The SCSI library is suitable to talk to any SCSI device without having
a special driver for it.
Cdrecord may be easily ported to any system that has a 
SCSI device driver similar to the scg driver.

The SCSI transport library has been taken from the sformat program.
Sformat is the first SCSI disk formatting/analyzing/repairing that runs on
SunOS/Solaris. The first release of sformat has been made for SunOS 3.0
(two years before Sun introduced their format utility). Sformat will be 
available in source within the next few months.

You *need* the SCSI general driver 'scg' in order to run cdrecord.
It is supplied binary in pkgadd(1m) format and is tested 
on Solaris 2.3, Solaris 2.4 & Solaris 2.5 (sparc).

It is _nice to have_ the 'fbk' driver to mount files that contain 
images of file systems. Fbk means File simulates Block Device.
It is supplied binary in pkgadd(1m) format and is tested
on Solaris 2.3, Solaris 2.4 & Solaris 2.5 (sparc).

cdrecord compiles and runs on Solaris x86, thanks to 
gert@fwi.uva.nl (Gert Poletiek) who did the tests.
The bitorder problems have been eliminated.

There may be some performance problems on Solaris x86.
A possible solution is to reduce BUF_SIZE to 32 kBytes.
It may be that the real reason is that the PC-architecture
has no IO-MMU and therefore is not able to do DVMA.
If this points out to be the reason, I have to
change the scg driver & cdrecord, but this would 
be neded on Linux anyway.

cdrecord should compile on SunOS, but you will need the scg driver for
SunOS in this case.

Cdrecord has been implemented with a Philips CDD 521
and the last release tested with a CDD 2000.
It should run also on:

	Philips CDD 522
	Philips CDD 2000
	Philips CDD 2600
	HP C4324/C4325	 (HP SureStore 4020i/6020i)
	Plasmon CDR 4220 (not tested)
	Grundig CDR-100  (not tested)
	Mitsumi CR-2401-TS (not tested)
	Yamaha CDR-100
	Yamaha CDR-102

Cdrecord-1.1 definitely does not run on a Plasmon RF-41000
which has the same drive mechanism as the Philips CDD-522 but a different
SCSI interface board.
I am interested to hear if cdrecord-1.2 runs on the Plasmon RF-41000.
NOTE: you have to switch off the warning and exit in the source 
if you want test this.

I currently have SCSI command reference manuals for:
	
	Philips CDD-522
	Philips CDD-2000
	Philips CDD-2600
	HP C4324/C4325	 (HP SureStore 4020i)
	Plasmon	RF-41000			*1
	Sony	CDU-924				*2
	Yamaha	CDR-100/102

*1	Will get support if there is someone willing to test form me
*2	Will get support within the next weeks.
	A Tester for Sony has been found.

All companies that support me with SCSI command reference manuals and drives
will get (continued) support in the following releases.

To install get:

	SCHILYscg.sparc.tar.Z	The scg driver in pkgadd format (sparc).
	SCHILYfbk.sparc.tar.Z	The fbk driver in pkgadd format (sparc).
	SCHILYscg.i386.tar.Z	The scg driver in pkgadd format (x86).
	SCHILYfbk.i386.tar.Z	The fbk driver in pkgadd format (x86).
	cdrecord-1.1.tar.Z	The cdrecord for Solaris distribution.

NOTE:	These tar archives are 100% ansi compatible. Solaris 2.x tar and GNU
	tar may get some minor trouble.
