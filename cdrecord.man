     CCCCddddrrrreeeeccccoooorrrrdddd is used to record data or audio Compact Discs on an
     Orange Book CD-Recorder.

     The _d_e_v_i_c_e refers to _s_c_s_i_b_u_s/_t_a_r_g_e_t/_l_u_n of the  CD-Recorder.
     Communication is done with the SCSI general driver ssssccccgggg.... Pos-
     sible syntax is:  _s_c_s_i_b_u_s,_t_a_r_g_e_t,_l_u_n or _t_a_r_g_e_t,_l_u_n.  In  the
     latter  case,  the  CD-Recorder  has  to be connected to the
     default SCSI bus of the machine.

     _S_c_s_i_b_u_s , _t_a_r_g_e_t and _l_u_n are integer numbers. _S_c_s_i_b_u_s  0  is
     the default SCSI bus on the machine. Watch the boot messages
     for more information or look into ////vvvvaaaarrrr////aaaaddddmmmm////mmmmeeeessssssssaaaaggggeeeessss for more
     information about the SCSI configuration of your machine.

     Each _t_r_a_c_k corresponds to a single file  that  contains  the
     prepared data for that track.  If the argument is `----', stan-
     dard input is used for that track.

          helps  to  debug  problems  during the writing process,
          that occur in the CD-Recorder. If you get  incomprehen-
          sible  error  messages  you should use this flag to get
          more detailed output.

          The CD-Recorder  will  go  through  all  steps  of  the
          recording  process,  but the laser is turned off during
          this procedure.  It is recommended to run several tests
          before  actually writing to a Compact Disk, if the tim-
          ing and load response of the system is not known.

          The  fixation will be done in a way that allows the CD-
          Recorder to append additional sessions later.  This  is
          done  by  generation a TOC with a link to the next pro-
          gram area. The so generated media is not 100%  compati-
          ble  to  manufactured  CD's.  Use  only for recording a
          multi session CD.

     ----ffffiiiixxxx  The disk will only be fixated (i.e. a TOC  for  a  CD-
          Reader  will be written). This may be used, if for some
          reason the disk has been written but not fixated.

          Set the speed factor of the writing process to #.  # is
          an integer, representing a multiple of the audio speed.
          This is about 151 KB/s for CD-ROM and  about  175  KB/s
          for CD-Audio.

          If this flag is  present,  all  subsequent  tracks  are
          written  in  CD-DA  (similar to Red Book) audio format.
          The file with  data  for  this  tracks  should  contain
          stereo, 16-bit digital audio with 44100 samples/s.  The
          byte order should be the following: MSB left, LSB left,
          MSB  right,  LSB  right,  MSB left and so on. The track
          should be a multiple of 2352 bytes. It is not  possible
          to put the master image of an audio track on a raw disk
          because data will be read in  multiple  of  2352  bytes
          during the recording process.

          If this flag is present, audio data is  swapped  before
          writing  to  CD.   This  is needed on some types of CD-
          Writers e.g. Yamaha and probably Sony because they  are
          using  the  wrong  byte  order for audio data (they are
          ignoring the  fact  that  the  SCSI-protocol  otherwise
          correctly uses network byte order). In a future release
          ccccddddrrrrwwwwiiiitttteeee will know itself which CD-Recorder  needs  byte

          written  in  CD-ROM (Yellow Book) format. The data is a
          multiple of 2048  bytes.   The  file  with  track  data
          should  contain  an  IIIISSSSOOOO----9999666666660000  or RRRRoooocccckkkk RRRRiiiiddddggggeeee filesystem

          image (see mmmmkkkkiiiissssooooffffssss for more details). If the track data
          is an uuuuffffssss filesystem image, fragment size should be set
          to 2 KB or more to allow CR-drives  with  2  KB  sector
          size to to be used for reading.

          -data is the default, if no other flag is present.

     ----ppppaaaadddd  If the track is a data track,  15  sectors  of  zeroed
          data  will  be added to the end of this and each subse-
          quent data track.  Use this if  your  CD-drive  is  not
          able  to read the last sectors of a track. If the track
          is an audio track, ccccddddrrrreeeeccccoooorrrrdddd will pad the audio data  to
          be  a multiple of 2352 bytes. The audio data padding is
          done with binary zeroes  which  is  equal  to  absolute
          silence.

     ----nnnnooooppppaaaadddd
          Do not pad the following tracks - the default.

          If this flag is present, all TOC entries for subsequent
          audio tracks will indicate that the audio data has been
          sampled with 50/15 µsec preemphasis.  The data, however
          is not modified during the process of transferring from
          file to disk. This option has no effect on data tracks.

     ----nnnnoooopppprrrreeeeeeeemmmmpppp
          If this flag is present, all TOC entries for subsequent
          audio tracks will indicate that the audio data has been
          mastered with linear data - this is the default.

          If the master image for the next track has been  stored
          on  a  raw  disk,  use this option to specify the valid
          amount of data on this disk. If the image of  the  next
          track  is  stored  in  a regular file, the size of that
          file is taken to determine the length  of  this  track.
          The  iiiissssoooossssiiiizzzzeeee  program,  usually included in the mmmmkkkkiiiissssooooffffssss

     For all examples below, it will  be  assumed  that  the  CD-
     Recorder  is  connected  to  the  primary  SCSI  bus  of the
     machine. The SCSI target id is set to 2.

     To record a pure CD-ROM at double speed, using data from the
     file _c_d_i_m_a_g_e._r_a_w:

         cdrecord -v speed=2 dev=2,0 cdimage.raw

CDRECORD(1)          Schily's USER COMMANDS           CDRECORD(1)



     To create an image for a ISO 9660 filesystem with Rock Ridge
     extensions:

         mkisofs -R -o cdimage.raw /home/joerg/master/tree

     To check the resulting file before writing to CD:

         mount -r -F fbk -o type=hsfs /dev/fbk0:cdimage.raw /mnt
         ls -lR /mnt
         umount /mnt

     If the overall speed of the system  is  sufficient  and  the
     structure  of  the  filesystem  is not too complex, cdrecord
     will run without creating an image of the ISO 9660  filesys-
     tem. Simply run the pipeline:

         mkisofs -R /master/tree | cdrecord -v speed=2 dev=2,0 -

     If your system is loaded, you should run mkisofs in the real
     time  class  too.   To raise the priority of mmmmkkkkiiiissssooooffffssss replace
     the command

         mkisofs -R /master/tree
     by
         priocntl -e -c RT -p 59 mkisofs -R /master/tree

     on Solaris and by

         nice -18 mkisofs -R /master/tree

     on SunOS.

     Cdrecord runs at priority 59  on  Solaris,  you  should  run
     mkisofs  at  no  more than priority 58. On SunOS, you should
     run mkisofs at no less than nice -18.

     Creating a CD-ROM without file system image on disk has been
     tested  on  a  Sparcstation-2  with a Yamaha CDR-100. It did
     work up to double speed.  A faster machine may  be  able  to
     handle quad speed also.

     To record a pure CD-DA (audio) at single  speed,  with  each
     track   contained   in   a   file   named   _t_r_a_c_k_0_1._c_d_a_u_d_i_o,
     _t_r_a_c_k_0_2._c_d_a_u_d_i_o, etc:

         cdrecord -v speed=1 dev=2,0 -audio track*.cdaudio

     To check if it will be ok to use double speed for the  exam-
     ple above. Use the dummy write option:

         cdrecord -v -dummy speed=2 dev=2,0 -audio track*.cdaudio

     contain more than one  track,  they  are  not  suitable  for
     direct  mass  production by CD manufacturers.  You will need

     the disks made with ccccddddrrrreeeeccccoooorrrrdddd will normally be read in all CD
     players. Some old players however may produce a  two  second
     click between two audio tracks.

     You should not use the ----mmmmuuuullllttttiiii flag, unless you know that you
     really  want  to  create  a  multi  session CD.  As ccccddddrrrreeeeccccoooorrrrdddd
     currently has no support  to  retrieve  the  first  writable
     address  for  the  next  session,  multi  session  CD's  are
     currently not possible. We will need a modified  mmmmkkkkiiiissssooooffffssss  to
     do this according the Kodak Photo-CD spec.

     The minimal size of a track is 4 seconds or 300 sectors.  If
     you  write  smaller  tracks,  the CD-Recorder will add dummy
     blocks. This is not an error,  even  though  the  SCSI-error
     message looks this way.

     CCCCddddrrrreeeeccccoooorrrrdddd has been tested  on  an  upgraded  Philips  CDD-521
     recorder at single and double speed on a SparcStation 20/502
     with no problems, slower computer systems should work  also.
     The  newer  Philips/HP/Plasmon/Grundig  drives  as  well  as
     Yamaha CDR-100 and CDR-102 work also.  The  Plasmon  RF-4100
     does  not work. Although it uses the same drive mechanism as
     the Philips CDD-522, it has a different SCSI-processor and a
     different  command set.  A Philips CDD-521 that has not been
     upgraded will not work.

     You should run several tests in single and double speed with
     the  ----dddduuuummmmmmmmyyyy option turned on if you are using ccccddddrrrreeeeccccoooorrrrdddd on an

     You should not  connect  old  drives  that  do  not  support
     disconnect/reconnect  to  either  the  SCSI bus that is con-
     nected to the CD-Recorder or the source disk.

     A Compact Disc can have no more than 99 tracks.

     When creating a disc with both audio and  data  tracks,  the
     data should be on track 1. CDplus has not yet been tested.

     Many systems are not able to read more than  a  single  data

     can be found at:

     If you have more information or  SCSI  command  manuals  for
     other CD-Recorders than Philips CDD 522 or the HP drive men-
     tioned above please contact the author.

     The Philips CDD 521 CD-Recorder (even in the  upgraded  ver-
     sion) has several firmware bugs. Some of them will force you
     to power cycle the device or to reboot the machine.

     You have 9 seconds to type ^C to abort  ccccddddrrrreeeeccccoooorrrrdddd  after  you
     see the message:

     Starting to write CD at speed %d in %s mode for %s session.

     A typical error message for a SCSI command looks like:

          cdrecord: I/O error. test unit ready: scsi sendcmd: no error
          status: 0x2 (CHECK CONDITION)
          Sense Bytes: 70 00 05 00 00 00 00 0A 00 00 00 00 25 00 00 00 00 00
          Sense Key: 0x5 Illegal Request, Code 0x25 (invalid lun) blk 0

     The first line gives information about the transport of  the
     command.   The  text  after  the first colon gives the error
     text for the system call from the view  of  the  kernel.  It
     usually  is:   IIII////OOOO  eeeerrrrrrrroooorrrr  unless other problems happen. The
     next words contain a short description for the SCSI  command
     that  fails. The rest of the line tell you if there were any
     problems for the transport of the command over the SCSI bus.
     ffffaaaattttaaaallll  eeeerrrrrrrroooorrrr means that it was not possible to transport the
     command (i.e.  no  device  present  at  the  requested  SCSI
     address).

     The second line gives information on the  SCSI  status  code
     returned  by  the  command,  if the transport of the command
     succeeds. This is error information from the SCSI device.

     The third line is a hex  dump  of  the  auto  request  sense
     information for the command.

     The fourth line is the error text for  the  sense  bytes  if
     available.   If  the  type of the device is known, the sense
     data is decoded from tables in _s_c_s_i_e_r_r_s._c .

     The following message is not an error:
          Track 01: Total bytes read/written: 2048/2048 (1 sectors).
          cdrecord: I/O error. flush cache: scsi sendcmd: no error
          status: 0x2 (CHECK CONDITION)
          Sense Bytes: F0 00 05 80 00 00 27 0A 00 00 00 00 B5 00 00 00 00 00
          Sense Key: 0x5 Illegal Request, Code 0xB5 (dummy data blocks added) blk -2147483609 valid

     It simply notifies, that a track that is  smaller  than  the
     minimum size has been expanded to 300 sectors.

BBBBUUUUGGGGSSSS
     CCCCddddrrrreeeeccccoooorrrrdddd should verify that the input data will fit  on  the
     media. Currently you get unpredictable results in this case.

     There should be an option to write index numbers  for  audio
     tracks.

     There should be a recover option to make disks usable,  that
     have been written during a power failure.
