     mmmmkkkkhhhhyyyybbbbrrrriiiidddd is effectively a pre-mastering program to  generate
     an  HFS/ISO9660/JOLIET  hybrid  filesystem.  It  is based on
     mmmmkkkkiiiissssooooffffssss(1) and  will  generate  a  pure  ISO9660  filesystem
     unless the HFS hybrid command line options are given.

     mmmmkkkkhhhhyyyybbbbrrrriiiidddd can generate a _t_r_u_e (or _s_h_a_r_e_d) HFS hybrid filesys-
     tem. The same files are seen as HFS files when accessed from
     a Macintosh and as ISO9660 files when  accessed  from  other
     machines. HFS stands for _H_i_e_r_a_r_c_h_i_c_a_l _F_i_l_e _S_y_s_t_e_m and is the
     native file system used on Macintosh computers.

     As an alternative, mmmmkkkkhhhhyyyybbbbrrrriiiidddd can generate  the  _A_p_p_l_e  _E_n_t_e_n_-
     _s_i_o_n_s  _t_o  _I_S_O_9_6_6_0  for  each file. These extensions provide
     each file with CREATOR, TYPE and certain Finder  Flags  when
     accessed  from  a  Macintosh. See the MMMMAAAACCCCIIIINNNNTTTTOOOOSSSSHHHH FFFFIIIILLLLEEEE FFFFOOOORRRRMMMMAAAATTTTSSSS

     mmmmkkkkhhhhyyyybbbbrrrriiiidddd takes a snapshot of a  given  directory  tree,  and
     generates a binary image which will correspond to an ISO9660
     or HFS filesystem when written to a block device.

     mmmmkkkkhhhhyyyybbbbrrrriiiidddd is also capable of generating the System Use  Shar-
     ing Protocol records specified by the Rock Ridge Interchange
     Protocol.  This is used to further describe the files in the
     iso9660  filesystem to a unix host, and provides information
     such as longer filenames, uid/gid,  posix  permissions,  and
     block and character devices.

     Each file written to the  iso9660  filesystem  must  have  a
     filename  in the 8.3 format (8 characters, period, 3 charac-
     ters, all upper case), even if Rock Ridge is in  use.   This
     filename is used on systems that are not able to make use of
     the  Rock  Ridge  extensions  (such  as  MS-DOS),  and  each
     filename  in each directory must be different from the other
     filenames in the same directory.  mmmmkkkkhhhhyyyybbbbrrrriiiidddd  generally  tries
     to  form correct names by forcing the unix filename to upper
     case and truncating as required, but often times this yields
     unsatisfactory  results when there are cases where the trun-
     cated names are not all unique.  mmmmkkkkhhhhyyyybbbbrrrriiiidddd assigns weightings
     to  each  filename,  and if two names that are otherwise the
     same are found the name with the lower priority  is  renamed
     to  have  a 3 digit number as an extension (where the number
     is guaranteed to be unique).  An example of  this  would  be
     the  files  foo.bar  and  foo.bar.~1~ - the file foo.bar.~1~
     would be written as FOO.000;1 and the file foo.bar would  be
     written as FOO.BAR;1

     When used with various HFS options, mmmmkkkkhhhhyyyybbbbrrrriiiidddd will attempt to
     recognise  files  stored in a number of Apple/Unix file for-
     mats and will copy the data and resource forks  as  well  as
     any relevant finder information. See the MMMMAAAACCCCIIIINNNNTTTTOOOOSSSSHHHH FFFFIIIILLLLEEEE FFFFOOOORRRR----

     Note that mmmmkkkkhhhhyyyybbbbrrrriiiidddd is not designed to communicate  with  the
     writer directly.  Most writers have proprietary command sets
     which vary from one manufacturer to another, and you need  a
     specialized  tool  to  actually  burn the disk.  The ccccddddwwwwrrrriiiitttteeee

     municating with the Phillips/IMS/Kodak, HP and Yamaha drives
     that  have been manufactured before 1997.  Most writers come
     with some version of DOS software that allows a direct image
     copy of an iso9660 image to the writer.  The current version
     of         ccccddddwwwwrrrriiiitttteeee         is         available         from

     The ccccddddrrrreeeeccccoooorrrrdddd utility is another utility capable  of  burning
     an actual disc.  The latest version of ccccddddrrrreeeeccccoooorrrrdddd is available
     from  ftp://ftp.fokus.gmd.de/pub/unix/cdrecord  Cdrecord  is
     under constant development.

     Also you should know that most cd writers are very  particu-
     lar about timing.  Once you start to burn a disc, you cannot
     let their buffer empty before you are done, or you will  end
     up  with  a  corrupt  disc.  Thus it is critical that you be
     able to maintain an uninterrupted data stream to the  writer
     for the entire time that the disc is being written.

     ppppaaaatttthhhhssssppppeeeecccc is the path of the directory tree to be copied into
     the  iso9660  filesystem.   Multiple paths can be specified,
     and mmmmkkkkhhhhyyyybbbbrrrriiiidddd will merge the files found in all of the speci-
     fied path components to form the cdrom image.

     It is possible to graft the paths at points other  than  the
     root  directory, and it is possible to graft files or direc-
     tories onto the cdrom image with names different  than  what
     they  have  in  the  source  filesystem.  This is easiest to
     illustrate with a  couple  of  examples.    Let's  start  by
     assuming  that  a local file ../old.lis exists, and you wish
     to include it in the cdrom image.


          foo/bar/=../old.lis

     will  include  the  file  old.lis  in  the  cdrom  image  at
     /foo/bar/old.lis, while

          foo/bar/xxx=../old.lis

     will  include  the  file  old.lis  in  the  cdrom  image  at
     /foo/bar/xxx.   The  same  sort  of  syntax can be used with
     directories as well.  mmmmkkkkhhhhyyyybbbbrrrriiiidddd will create  any  directories
     required such that the graft points exist on the cdrom image
     - the directories do not need to appear in one of the paths.
     Any  directories  that are created on the fly like this will
     have permissions 0555 and appear to be owned by  the  person
     running  mkhybrid.   If you wish other permissions or owners
     of the intermediate directories, the easiest solution is  to
     create  real  directories  in  the  path  such that mkhybrid
     doesn't have to invent them.

     mmmmkkkkhhhhyyyybbbbrrrriiiidddd will also run on Win9X/NT4 machines  when  compiled
     with        Cygnus'       cygwin       (available       from
     http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin/). Therefore most refer-
     ences in this man page to _U_n_i_x can be replaced with _W_i_n_3_2.

          are  needed  to  make  a bootable CD for sparc systems.
          There may be empty fields in the comma separated  list.
          This  option  is required to make a bootable CD for Sun
          sparc systems.  If the ----BBBB or  ---- ssssppppaaaarrrrcccc----bbbbooooooootttt  option  has
          been specified, the first sector of the resulting image
          will contain a Sun disk label. This disk  label  speci-
          fies  slice  0  for  the  iso9660 image and slice 1 ...
          slice 7 for the boot images that  have  been  specified
          with  this option. Byte offset 512 ... 8191 within each
          of the additional boot images must  contain  a  primary
          boot that works for the appropriate sparc architecture.
          The rest of each of the images usually contains an  ufs
          filesystem that is used primary kernel boot stage.

          The implemented boot method is the  boot  method  found
          with  SunOS  4.x  and  SunOS 5.x.  However, it does not
          depend on SunOS internals but only on properties of the
          Open  Boot  prom.  For this reason, it should be usable
          for any OS that boots off a sparc system.

          If the special filename ............ is used, the actual and all
          following  boot  partitions  are mapped to the previous
          partition. If mmmmkkkkhhhhyyyybbbbrrrriiiidddd is called with ----GGGG _i_m_a_g_e ---- BBBB  ...

          boot  image  that is located in the first 16 sectors of
          the disk is used for all architectures.

          sectors of the CD. The first 16 sectors are the sectors
          that are located  before  the  iso9660  primary  volume
          descriptor.  If this option is used together with the ----

          not be readable on MS-DOS.

          allows  filenames  of  up to 31 characters.  If you use
          this option, the disc may be difficult to use on a  MS-

          ally,  a  leading dot is replaced with an underscore in

          shell  wild-card-style  pattern that must match part of
          the filename (not the path as with option ----xxxx).  Techni-
          cally _g_l_o_b is matched against the _d->_d__n_a_m_e part of the
          directory  entry.   Multiple  globs  may  be  excluded.
          Example:

          mkhybrid -o rom -m '*.o' -m core -m foobar

          would exclude all files ending in ".o",  called  "core"
          or "foobar" to be copied to CDROM. Note that if you had
          a directory called "foobar" it too (and of  course  all
          its descendants) would be excluded.

          NOTE: The -m and -x option description should  both  be
          updated,  they  are wrong.  Both now work identical and
          use filename globbing. A file is excluded if either the

          Print estimated filesystem size and exit.  This  option
          is  needed  for  Disk  At  Once mode and with some CD-R

          it  is needed to know the size of the filesystem before
          the actual CD-creation is done.  The option -print-size
          allows  to get this size from a "dry-run" before the CD
          is actually written.

     ----rrrr    This is like the -R option,  but  file  ownership  and
          modes  are  set to more useful values.  The uid and gid
          are set to zero, because they are usually  only  useful
          on  the  author's system, and not useful to the client.
          All the file read bits are set true, so that files  and
          directories  are  globally  readable on the client.  If
          any execute bit is set for a file, set all of the  exe-
          cute  bits, so that executables are globally executable
          on the client.  If any search bit is set for  a  direc-
          tory,  set  all of the search bits, so that directories
          are globally searchable on the client.  All write  bits
          are  cleared,  because the CD-Rom will be mounted read-
          only in any case.  If any of the special mode bits  are
          set, clear them, because file locks are not useful on a
          read-only file system, and set-id bits are  not  desir-
          able  for uid 0 or gid 0.  When used on Win32, the exe-
          cute bit is set on _a_l_l files. This is a result  of  the
          lack  of file permissions on Win32 and the Cygwin POSIX
          emulation layer.

     A Macintosh file has two properties associated with it which
     define  which  application created the file, the _C_R_E_A_T_O_R and
     what data the file contains, the _T_Y_P_E.  Both are (exactly) 4
     letter  strings.  Usually  this  allows  a Macintosh user to
     double-click on a file and launch  the  correct  application
     etc.  The CREATOR and TYPE of a particular file can be found
     by using something like ResEdit (or similar) on a Macintosh.

     The CREATOR and TYPE information is stored in all the  vari-
     ous  Apple/Unix encoded files.  For other files it is possi-
     ble to base the CREATOR and TYPE on the filename's extension
     using  a  _m_a_p_p_i_n_g  file  (the  -_m_a_p option) and/or using the
     _m_a_g_i_c _n_u_m_b_e_r (usually a _s_i_g_n_a_t_u_r_e in the first few bytes) of
     a file (the -_m_a_g_i_c option). If both these options are given,
     then their order on the command line is important. If the  -
     _m_a_p  option  is given first, then a filename extension match
     is attempted before a magic number match. However, if the  -
     _m_a_g_i_c  option  is  given first, then a magic number match is
     attempted before a filename extension match.

     If a mapping or magic file is not used, or no match is found
     then  the default CREATOR and TYPE for all regular files can
     be set by using entries in the ....mmmmkkkkiiiissssooooffffssssrrrrcccc file or using the
     -_h_f_s-_c_r_e_a_t_o_r and/or -_h_f_s-_t_y_p_e options, otherwise the default
     CREATOR and TYPE are 'unix' and 'TEXT'.

     The format of the _m_a_p_p_i_n_g file is the same _a_f_p_f_i_l_e format as
     used by _a_u_f_s.  This file has five columns for the _e_x_t_e_n_s_i_o_n,
     _f_i_l_e _t_r_a_n_s_l_a_t_i_o_n, _C_R_E_A_T_O_R, _T_Y_P_E and _C_o_m_m_e_n_t.  Lines starting
     with the '#' character are comment lines and are ignored. An
     example file would be like:

     The format of the file is  described  in  the  mmmmaaaaggggiiiicccc(4)  man
     page. The only difference here is that for each entry in the
     magic file, the _m_e_s_s_a_g_e for the initial  offset  mmmmuuuusssstttt  be  4
     characters  for the CREATOR followed by 4 characters for the
     TYPE - white space is optional between them. Any other char-
     acters on this line are ignored.  Continuation lines (start-
     ing with a '>') are  also  ignored  i.e.  only  the  initial
     offset lines are used.

     Using the -_m_a_g_i_c option may significantly increase  process-
     ing  time  as  each file has to opened and read to find it's
     magic number.

     In summary, for all files, the default CREATOR is 'unix' and
     the  default  TYPE is 'TEXT'.  These can be changed by using
     entries in the ._m_k_i_s_o_f_s_r_c file or by using the - _h_f_s-_c_r_e_a_t_o_r
     and/or -_h_f_s-_t_y_p_e options.

     If the a file is in one of the known Apple/Unix formats (and
     the format has been selected), then the CREATOR and TYPE are
     taken from the values stored in the Apple/Unix file.

     Other files can have their CREATOR and TYPE set  from  their
     file name extension (the -_m_a_p option), or their magic number
     (the -_m_a_g_i_c option). If the default match  is  used  in  the
     _m_a_p_p_i_n_g file, then these values override the default CREATOR
     and TYPE.

     A   full   CREATOR/TYPE   database   can   be    found    at
     http://www.angelfire.com/il/szekely/index.html

     Macintosh files have two parts called the _D_a_t_a and  _R_e_s_o_u_r_c_e
     fork.  Either  may  be  empty. Unix (and many other OSs) can
     only cope with files having one part (or fork).  To  add  to
     this, Macintosh files have a number of attributes associated
     with them - probably the most important  are  the  TYPE  and
     CREATOR.  Again Unix has no concept of these types of attri-
     butes.

     e.g. a Macintosh file may be a JPEG image where the image is
     stored  in  the  Data fork and a desktop thumbnail stored in
     the Resource fork. It is usually the information in the data
     fork that is useful across platforms.

     Therefore to store a Macintosh file on a Unix filesystem,  a
     way has to be found to cope with the two forks and the extra
     attributes (which are  referred  to  as  the  _f_i_n_d_e_r  _i_n_f_o).
     Unfortunately,  it  seems  that  every software package that
     stores Macintosh files on Unix has chosen a completely  dif-
     ferent storage method.

          Separate finder.dat for each data fork directory.

          Note: _m_k_h_y_b_r_i_d needs to know  the  native  FAT  cluster
          size  of the disk that the PC Exchange files are on (or

          The  finder  info  is  stored  as  a NTFS _s_t_r_e_a_m called
          "filename:Afp_AfpInfo".  These  streams  are   normally
          invisible to the user.

          Warning: mkhybrid only partially supports the SFM  for-
          mat.  If  an HFS file or folder stored on the NT server
          contains an _i_l_l_e_g_a_l NT character in its name,  then  NT
          converts  these characters to _P_r_i_v_a_t_e _U_s_e _U_n_i_c_o_d_e char-
          acters. The characters are: " * / < > ?  | also a space
          or period if it is the last character of the file name,
          character codes 0x01 to 0x1f (control  characters)  and
          Apple' apple logo.

          Unfortunately, these private Unicode characters are not
          readable  by  the mkhybrid NT executable. Therefore any
          file or directory name containing these characters will
          be  ignored - including the contents of any such direc-
          tory.

     _m_k_h_y_b_r_i_d will attempt to set the  CREATOR,  TYPE,  date  and
     possibly  other flags from the finder info. Additionally, if
     it exists, the Macintosh filename is  set  from  the  finder
     info,  otherwise  the  Macintosh  name  is based on the Unix
     filename - see the MACINTOSH FILE NAMES section below.

     When using the -_a_p_p_l_e  option,  the  TYPE  and  CREATOR  are
     stored  in  the  optional  System  Use  or SUSP field in the
     ISO9660 Directory Record - in much the same way as the  Rock
     Ridge  attributes  are. In fact to make life easy, the Apple
     extensions are added at the beginning of the  existing  Rock
     Ridge  attributes  (i.e. to get the Apple extensions you get
     the Rock Ridge extensions as well).

     The Apple extensions require the resource fork to be  stored
     as  an ISO9660 _a_s_s_o_c_i_a_t_e_d file. This is just like any normal
     file stored in the ISO9660 filesystem except that the  asso-
     ciated  file  flag  is  set in the Directory Record (bit 2).
     This file has the same name as the data fork (the file  seen

     by   non-Apple  machines).  Associated  files  are  normally
     ignored by other OSs

     When using the -_h_f_s option, the TYPE and CREATOR plus  other
     finder  info,  are  stored  in a separate HFS directory, not
     visible on the ISO9660 volume. The HFS directory  references
     the same data and resource fork files described above.

     In most cases, it is better to use the -_h_f_s  option  instead
     of  the   - _a_p_p_l_e  option, as the latter imposes the limited
     ISO9660 characters allowed in filenames. However, the  Apple
     extensions  do  give the advantage that the files are packed
     on the disk more efficiently and it may be possible  to  fit
     more  files  on  a CD - important when the total size of the
     source files is approaching 650MB.

     Where possible, the HFS filename  that  is  stored  with  an
     Apple/Unix file is used for the HFS part of the CD. However,
     not all the Apple/Unix encodings store the HFS filename with
     the  finderinfo. In these cases, the Unix filename is used -
     with escaped special characters. Special characters  include
     '/' and characters with codes over 127.

     Aufs escapes these characters by using ":" followed  by  the
     character  code  as  two hex digits. Netatalk and EtherShare
     have a similar scheme, but uses "%" instead of a ":".

     If mkhybrid can't find an HFS filename,  then  it  uses  the
     Unix  name,  with  any  %xx or :xx characters (xx == two hex
     digits) converted to a single character code.  If  "xx"  are
     not  hex  digits  ([0-9a-fA-F]),  then they are left alone -
     although any remaining ":" is converted to "%" as  colon  is
     the HFS directory separator. Care must be taken, as an ordi-
     nary Unix file with %xx or :xx will also be converted. e.g.

     This:2fFile   converted to This/File

     This:File     converted to This%File

     This:t7File   converted to This%t7File

     Although HFS filenames appear to  support  upper  and  lower
     case  letters,  the filesystem is case insensitive. i.e. the
     filenames "aBc" and "AbC" are the same. If a file  is  found
     in  a  directory  with the same HFS name, then _m_k_h_y_b_r_i_d will
     attempt, where possible, to make a unique name by adding '_'
     characters to one of the filenames.

MKHYBRID(8)          Maintenance Procedures           MKHYBRID(8)



     If an HFS filename exists for a file, then mkhybrid can  use
     this  name as the starting point for the ISO9660, Joliet and
     Rock Ridge filenames using the -_m_a_c-_n_a_m_e option. Normal Unix
     files  without  an  HFS name will still use their Unix name.
     e.g.

     If  a  _M_a_c_B_i_n_a_r_y  (or  _P_C  _E_x_c_h_a_n_g_e)  file  is   stored   as
     _s_o_m_e_i_m_a_g_e._g_i_f._b_i_n on the Unix filesystem, but contains a HFS
     file called _s_o_m_e_i_m_a_g_e._g_i_f, then this is the name that  would
     appear  on the HFS part of the CD. However, as mkhybrid uses
     the Unix name as the starting point  for  the  other  names,
     then   the   ISO9660   name   generated   will  probably  be
     _S_O_M_E_I_M_A_G._B_I_N   and   the   Joliet/Rock   Ridge   would    be
     _s_o_m_e_i_m_a_g_e._g_i_f._b_i_n.   Although the actual data (in this case)
     is a GIF image. This option will use the HFS filename as the
     starting  point  and  the  ISO9660  name  will  probably  be
     _S_O_M_E_I_M_A_G._G_I_F   and   the   Joliet/Rock   Ridge   would    be
     _s_o_m_e_i_m_a_g_e._g_i_f.

     Using the -_m_a_c-_n_a_m_e option will not currently work with the
     - _T  option  -  the  Unix name will be used in the TRANS.TBL
     file, not the Macintosh name.

     The existing mkhybrid code will filter out any illegal char-
     acters for the ISO9660 and Joliet filenames, but as mkhybrid
     expects to be dealing directly with Unix  names,  it  leaves
     the  Rock  Ridge  names  as  is.   But as '/' is a legal HFS
     filename character, the -_m_a_c-_n_a_m_e option coverts  '/'  to  a
     '_' in a Rock Ridge filenames.

     If the Apple extensions are  used,  then  only  the  ISO9660
     filenames  will  appear  on  the  Macintosh. However, as the
     Macintosh ISO9660 drivers can use _L_e_v_e_l  _2  filenames,  then
     you  can use the -_l option without problems on a Macintosh -
     still take care over the names, for  example  _t_h_i_s._f_i_l_e._n_a_m_e
     will  be converted to _T_H_I_S._F_I_L_E i.e. only have one '.', also
     filename _a_b_c_d_e_f_g_h will be seen  as  _A_B_C_D_E_F_G_H  but  _a_b_c_d_e_f_g_h_i
     will  be  seen  as  _A_B_C_D_E_F_G_H_I.  i.e. with a '.' at the end -
     don't   know   if   this   is   a   Macintosh   problem   or
     mkisofs/mkhybrid problem. All filenames will be in uppercase
     when viewed on a Macintosh. Of course,  DOS/Win3.X  machines
     will not be able to see Level 2 filenames...

     To give a HFS CD a custom icon,  make  sure  the  root  (top

     file. To give a volume a custom icon on a Macintosh, an icon
     has  to  be  pasted over the volume's icon in the "Get Info"
     box of the volume. This creates  an  invisible  file  called
     'Icon\r'  ('\r'  is  the 'carriage return' character) in the
     root folder.

     A custom folder icon is very similar  -  an  invisible  file
     called 'Icon\r' exits in the folder itself.

     Probably the easiest way to create a custom icon that  mkhy-
     brid can use, is to format a blank HFS floppy disk on a Mac,
     paste an icon to its "Get Info" box. If using Linux with the
     HFS module installed, mount the floppy using something like:

                mount -t hfs /dev/fd0 /mnt/floppy

     The floppy will be mounted as a CAP file system by  default.
     Then run mkhybrid using something like:

                mkhybrid --cap -o output source_dir /mnt/floppy

     If you are not using Linux, then you can use the hfsutils to
     copy  the icon file from the floppy. However, care has to be
     taken, as the icon file contains a control character. e.g.

                hmount /dev/fd0
                hdir -a
                hcopy -m Icon^V^M icon_dir/icon

     Where '^V^M' is control-V followed by  control-M.  Then  run
     mmmmkkkkhhhhyyyybbbbrrrriiiidddd by using something like:

                mkhybrid --macbin -o output source_dir icon_dir

     The procedure for creating/using custom folder icons is very
     similar  -  paste  an  icon  to  folder's "Get Info" box and
     transfer the resulting 'Icon\r' file to the relevant  direc-
     tory in the mkhybrid source tree.

     You may want to hide the icon files  from  the  ISO9660  and
     Joliet trees.

     To give a custom icon to a Joliet CD,  follow  the  instruc-
     tions                        found                       at:

     It _m_a_y be possible to make  the  hybrid  CD  bootable  on  a
     Macintosh.

     A bootable HFS CD requires an Apple CD-ROM  (or  compatible)
     driver,  a  bootable HFS partition and the necessary System,
     Finder, etc. files.

     A driver can be obtained from any other  Macintosh  bootable
     CD-ROM using the _a_p_p_l_e__d_r_i_v_e_r utility. This file can then be
     used with the -_b_o_o_t-_h_f_s-_f_i_l_e option.

     The HFS partition (i.e. the hybrid disk in  our  case)  must
     contain  a suitable System Folder, again from another CD-ROM
     or disk.

     For a partition to be bootable, it must have it's _b_o_o_t _b_l_o_c_k
     set.  The  boot block is in the first two blocks of a parti-
     tion. For a non-bootable partition the boot block is full of
     zeros.  Normally,  when a System file is copied to partition
     on a Macintosh disk, the boot block is filled with a  number
     of  required  settings - unfortunately I don't know the full
     spec for the boot block, so I'm guessing that the  following
     will work OK.

     Therefore, the utility _a_p_p_l_e__d_r_i_v_e_r also extracts  the  boot
     block  from  the  first  HFS partition it finds on the given

     This file contains pointers which may not be easily or reli-

     The format of this table is as follows; all integers are  in

     The following example puts different files on  the  CD  that
     all  have  the name README, but have different contents when

     "cd_dir"  on  the CD along with the three README files - but
     only one will be seen from each of the three filesystems:

     because  we  must  generate  a complete  copy of an existing
     filesystem on a disk in the  iso9660 filesystem.   The  name
     mkisofs  is  probably a bit of a misnomer, since it not only
     creates the filesystem, but it also populates it as well.

     Eric Youngdale <ericy@gnu.ai.mit.edu> or  <eric@andante.org>
     wrote  both  the  Linux isofs9660 filesystem and the mkisofs
     utility.  The copyright for the mkisofs utility is  held  by

     I have had to make several assumptions on how I  expect  the
     modified  libhfs  routines  to  work,  however  there may be
     situations that either I haven't thought of, or come  across
     when  these  assumptions  fail.  Therefore I can't guarantee
     that mkhybrid will work as expected (although I haven't  had
     a  major  problem  yet). Most of the HFS features work fine,
     however, some are not fully  tested.  These  are  marked  as
     _A_l_p_h_a above.

     Although HFS filenames appear to  support  upper  and  lower
     case  letters,  the filesystem is case insensitive. i.e. the
     filenames "aBc" and "AbC" are the same. If a file  is  found
     in  a  directory  with the same HFS name, then _m_k_h_y_b_r_i_d will
     attempt, where possible, to make a unique name by adding '_'
     characters to one of the filenames.

     HFS file/directory names that share the first 31  characters
     have  _N' (N == decimal number) substituted for the last few
     characters to generate unique names.

     Care must be  taken  when  "grafting"  Apple/Unix  files  or
     directories  (see above for the method and syntax involved).
     It is not possible to use  a  new  name  for  an  Apple/Unix
     encoded  file/directory.  e.g.  If a Apple/Unix encoded file
     called "oldname" is to added to the CD, then you can not use
     the command line:

          mkhybrid -o output.raw -hfs newname=oldname cd_dir

     mkhybrid will be unable to decode  "oldname".  However,  you
     can graft Apple/Unix encoded files or directories as long as

     you do not attempt to give them new names as above.

     When creating an HFS volume with the multisession options, ----
     MMMM  and ----CCCC, only files in the last session will be in the HFS
     volume. i.e. mkhybrid can not _a_d_d existing files from previ-
     ous sessions to the HFS volume.

     Symbolic links (as with all other non-regular files) are not
     added to the HFS directory.

     Hybrid volumes may be larger than pure ISO9660 volumes  con-
     taining the same data.

     The resulting hybrid  volume  can  be  accessed  on  a  Unix
     machine  by using the hfsutils routines. However, no changes
     should be made to the contents of the volume as it's  not  a
     "real" HFS volume.

     ---- TTTT  option  -  the  Unix name will be used in the TRANS.TBL
     file, not the Macintosh name.

     Although mmmmkkkkhhhhyyyybbbbrrrriiiidddd does not alter the contents of a file,  if
     a  binary  file  has it's TYPE set as 'TEXT', it _m_a_y be read
     incorrectly on a Macintosh. Therefore a  better  choice  for
     the default TYPE may be '????'
