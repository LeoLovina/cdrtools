     RRRReeeeaaaaddddccccdddd is used to read or write Compact Discs.

     The _d_e_v_i_c_e refers to _s_c_s_i_b_u_s/_t_a_r_g_e_t/_l_u_n of the  drive.  Com-
     munication  on  _S_u_n_O_S  is  done with the SCSI general driver
     ssssccccgggg.... Other operating systems are using a library  simulation
     of    this    driver.     Possible    syntax    is:     ddddeeeevvvv====
     _s_c_s_i_b_u_s,_t_a_r_g_e_t,_l_u_n or ddddeeeevvvv==== _t_a_r_g_e_t,_l_u_n.  In the latter  case,
     the drive has to be connected to the default SCSI bus of the
     machine.  _S_c_s_i_b_u_s, _t_a_r_g_e_t and _l_u_n are integer numbers.  Some
     operating  systems  or  SCSI  transport  implementations may
     require to specify a filename in addition.  In this case the
     corect     syntax     for     the     device    is:     ddddeeeevvvv====
     _d_e_v_i_c_e_n_a_m_e:_s_c_s_i_b_u_s,_t_a_r_g_e_t,  or  ddddeeeevvvv====  _d_e_v_i_c_e_n_a_m_e:_t_a_r_g_e_t,_l_u_n.
     If  the  name  of the device node that has been specified on
     such a system referres to exactly one SCSI device, a  short-
     hand  in the form ddddeeeevvvv==== _d_e_v_i_c_e_n_a_m_e:@ or ddddeeeevvvv==== _d_e_v_i_c_e_n_a_m_e:@,_l_u_n
     may be used instead of ddddeeeevvvv==== _d_e_v_i_c_e_n_a_m_e:_s_c_s_i_b_u_s,_t_a_r_g_e_t,


     To make rrrreeeeaaaaddddccccdddd portable to all UNIX  platforms,  the  syntax
     ddddeeeevvvv====  _d_e_v_i_c_e_n_a_m_e:_s_c_s_i_b_u_s,_t_a_r_g_e_t, is preferred as is hides OS
     specific knowledge about device  names  from  the  user.   A
     specific  OS must not necessarily support a way to specify a
     real   device   file   name   nor   a   way    to    specify
     _s_c_s_i_b_u_s,_t_a_r_g_e_t,_l_u_n.


     _S_c_s_i_b_u_s 0 is the default SCSI bus on the machine. Watch  the
     boot   messages   for   more   information   or   look  into

     You should not  connect  old  drives  that  do  not  support
     disconnect/reconnect  to  either  the  SCSI bus that is con-
     nected to the CD-Recorder or the source disk.

     You  should note that rrrreeeeaaaaddddccccdddd uses a hack, that tries to emu-
     late the functionality of the  scg  driver.   Unfortunately,
     the sg driver on LLLLiiiinnnnuuuuxxxx has several severe bugs:

     +o     It cannot see if a SCSI command could not be  sent  at
          all.

     +o     It cannot get the SCSI status byte.  RRRReeeeaaaaddddccccdddd  for  that
          reason  cannot  report  failing  SCSI  commands in some
          situations.

     +o     It cannot get real DMA count of transfer. RRRReeeeaaaaddddccccdddd  can-
          not tell you if there is an DMA residual count.

     +o     It cannot get number of  bytes  valid  in  auto  sense
          data.   RRRReeeeaaaaddddccccdddd  cannot  tell you if device transfers no
          sense data at all.

      +o     It  fetches  to  few  data  in  auto  request   sense
          (CCS/SCSI-2/SCSI-3 needs >= 18).

     A typical error message for a SCSI command looks like:

     The first line gives information about the transport of  the
     command.   The  text  after  the first colon gives the error
     text for the system call from the view  of  the  kernel.  It
     usually  is:   IIII////OOOO  eeeerrrrrrrroooorrrr  unless other problems happen. The
     next words contain a short description for the SCSI  command
     that fails. The rest of the line tells you if there were any
     problems for the transport of the command over the SCSI bus.
     ffffaaaattttaaaallll  eeeerrrrrrrroooorrrr means that it was not possible to transport the
     command (i.e.  no  device  present  at  the  requested  SCSI
     address).

     The second line prints the SCSI command descriptor block for
     the failed command.

     The third line gives information on  the  SCSI  status  code
     returned  by  the  command,  if the transport of the command
     succeeds. This is error information from the SCSI device.

     The fourth line is a hex dump  of  the  auto  request  sense
     information for the command.

     The fifth line is the error text for the sense key if avail-
     able,  followed  by the segment number that is only valid if
     the command was a _c_o_p_y command. If the error message is  not
     directly  related  to the current command, the text _d_e_f_e_r_r_e_d
     _e_r_r_o_r is appended.

     The sixth line is the error text for the sense code and  the
     sense  qualifier if available.  If the type of the device is
     known, the sense data is decoded from tables in _s_c_s_i_e_r_r_s._c .
     The text is followed by the error value for a field replace-
     able unit.

     The seventh line prints the block number that is related  to
     the  failed  command  and  text for several error flags. The
     block number may not be valid.
