     RRRReeeeaaaaddddccccdddd is used to read or write Compact Discs.

     The _d_e_v_i_c_e refers to _s_c_s_i_b_u_s/_t_a_r_g_e_t/_l_u_n of the  drive.  Com-
     munication  on  _S_u_n_O_S  is  done with the SCSI general driver
     ssssccccgggg.... Other operating systems are using a library  simulation
     of    this    driver.     Possible    syntax    is:     ddddeeeevvvv====
     _s_c_s_i_b_u_s,_t_a_r_g_e_t,_l_u_n or ddddeeeevvvv==== _t_a_r_g_e_t,_l_u_n.  In the latter  case,
     the drive has to be connected to the default SCSI bus of the
     machine.  _S_c_s_i_b_u_s, _t_a_r_g_e_t and _l_u_n are integer numbers.  Some
     operating  systems  or  SCSI  transport  implementations may
     require to specify a filename in addition.  In this case the
     correct     syntax     for     the    device    is:     ddddeeeevvvv====
     _d_e_v_i_c_e_n_a_m_e:_s_c_s_i_b_u_s,_t_a_r_g_e_t,  or  ddddeeeevvvv====  _d_e_v_i_c_e_n_a_m_e:_t_a_r_g_e_t,_l_u_n.
     If  the  name  of the device node that has been specified on
     such a system refers to exactly one SCSI device, a shorthand
     in  the  form ddddeeeevvvv==== _d_e_v_i_c_e_n_a_m_e:@ or ddddeeeevvvv==== _d_e_v_i_c_e_n_a_m_e:@,_l_u_n may
     be used instead of ddddeeeevvvv==== _d_e_v_i_c_e_n_a_m_e:_s_c_s_i_b_u_s,_t_a_r_g_e_t,


     To access remote SCSI devices, you need to prepend the  SCSI
     device  name by a remote device indicator. The remote device
     indicator is either RRRREEEEMMMMOOOOTTTTEEEE::::_u_s_e_r@_h_o_s_t:  or  RRRREEEEMMMMOOOOTTTTEEEE::::_h_o_s_t:
     A valid remote SCSI device name may  be:   RRRREEEEMMMMOOOOTTTTEEEE::::_u_s_e_r@_h_o_s_t:
     to  allow remote SCSI bus scanning or RRRREEEEMMMMOOOOTTTTEEEE::::_u_s_e_r@_h_o_s_t:_1,_0,_0
     to access the SCSI device at _h_o_s_t connected to  SCSI  bus  #
     1,target 0 lun 0.


     To make rrrreeeeaaaaddddccccdddd portable to all UNIX  platforms,  the  syntax
     ddddeeeevvvv====  _d_e_v_i_c_e_n_a_m_e:_s_c_s_i_b_u_s,_t_a_r_g_e_t, is preferred as is hides OS
     specific knowledge about device  names  from  the  user.   A
     specific  OS must not necessarily support a way to specify a
     real   device   file   name   nor   a   way    to    specify
     _s_c_s_i_b_u_s,_t_a_r_g_e_t,_l_u_n.


     _S_c_s_i_b_u_s 0 is the default SCSI bus on the machine. Watch  the
     boot   messages   for   more   information   or   look  into

     guration  of  your  machine.  If you have problems to figure
     out what values for _s_c_s_i_b_u_s,_t_a_r_g_e_t,_l_u_n should be  used,  try

          Sets the SCSI target for the drive, see notes above.  A
          typical   device  specification  is  ddddeeeevvvv====_6,_0  .   If  a
          filename must be provided together with  the  numerical
          target  specification,  the  filename is implementation
          specific.  The correct filename in  this  case  can  be
          found  in  the  system  specific  manuals of the target
          operating system.  On a _F_r_e_e_B_S_D system without _C_A_M sup-
          port,   you  need  to  use  the  control  device  (e.g.
          /_d_e_v/_r_c_d_0._c_t_l).  A correct device specification in this
          case may be ddddeeeevvvv====/_d_e_v/_r_c_d_0._c_t_l:@ .

          On Linux, drives connected to a parallel  port  adapter
          are  mapped  to  a virtual SCSI bus. Different adapters
          are mapped to different targets on  this  virtual  SCSI
          bus.

          If no _d_e_v option is present, ccccddddrrrreeeeccccoooorrrrdddd will try  to  get

          an  label  name  that  may  be  found   in   the   file
          /etc/default/cdrecord (see FILES section).

          Set  the  default  SCSI  command  timeout  value  to  #
          seconds.   The  default  SCSI  command  timeout  is the
          minimum timeout used for sending SCSI commands.   If  a
          SCSI  command  fails  due  to a timeout, you may try to
          raise  the  default  SCSI  command  timeout  above  the
          timeout  value  of  the failed command.  If the command
          runs correctly with a raised  command  timeout,  please
          report  the  better timeout value and the corresponding
          command to the author of the program.   If  no  _t_i_m_e_o_u_t
          option  is  present, a default timeout of 40 seconds is
          used.

     A typical error message for a SCSI command looks like:

          readcd: I/O error. test unit ready: scsi sendcmd: no error
          CDB:  00 20 00 00 00 00

          Sense flags: Blk 0 (not valid)
          cmd finished after 0.002s timeout 40s

     The first line gives information about the transport of  the
     command.   The  text  after  the first colon gives the error
     text for the system call from the view  of  the  kernel.  It
     usually  is:   IIII////OOOO  eeeerrrrrrrroooorrrr  unless other problems happen. The
     next words contain a short description for the SCSI  command
     that fails. The rest of the line tells you if there were any
     problems for the transport of the command over the SCSI bus.
     ffffaaaattttaaaallll  eeeerrrrrrrroooorrrr means that it was not possible to transport the
     command (i.e.  no  device  present  at  the  requested  SCSI
     address).

     The second line prints the SCSI command descriptor block for
     the failed command.

     The third line gives information on  the  SCSI  status  code
     returned  by  the  command,  if the transport of the command
     succeeds. This is error information from the SCSI device.

     The fourth line is a hex dump  of  the  auto  request  sense
     information for the command.

     The fifth line is the error text for the sense key if avail-
     able,  followed  by the segment number that is only valid if
     the command was a _c_o_p_y command. If the error message is  not
     directly  related  to the current command, the text _d_e_f_e_r_r_e_d
     _e_r_r_o_r is appended.

     The sixth line is the error text for the sense code and  the
     sense  qualifier if available.  If the type of the device is
     known, the sense data is decoded from tables in _s_c_s_i_e_r_r_s._c .
     The text is followed by the error value for a field replace-
     able unit.

READCD(1)            Schily's USER COMMANDS             READCD(1)



     The seventh line prints the block number that is related  to
     the  failed  command  and  text for several error flags. The
     block number may not be valid.

     The eight line reports the timeout set up for  this  commans
     and the time that the command realy needed to be finished.
