     CCCCddddrrrreeeeccccoooorrrrdddd is used to record data or audio Compact Discs on an
     Orange Book CD-Recorder.

     The _d_e_v_i_c_e refers to _s_c_s_i_b_u_s/_t_a_r_g_e_t/_l_u_n of the  CD-Recorder.
     Communication  on _S_u_n_O_S is done with the SCSI general driver
     ssssccccgggg.... Other operating systems are using a library  simulation
     of    this    driver.     Possible    syntax    is:     ddddeeeevvvv====
     _s_c_s_i_b_u_s,_t_a_r_g_e_t,_l_u_n or ddddeeeevvvv==== _t_a_r_g_e_t,_l_u_n.  In the latter  case,
     the  CD-Recorder has to be connected to the default SCSI bus
     of the machine.

     _S_c_s_i_b_u_s,  _t_a_r_g_e_t  and  _l_u_n  are  integer  numbers.  To  make
     ccccddddrrrreeeeccccoooorrrrdddd  portable to all UNIX platforms, there is no way to
     specify a real device file name.  _S_c_s_i_b_u_s 0 is  the  default
     SCSI  bus  on  the machine. Watch the boot messages for more
     information or look into ////vvvvaaaarrrr////aaaaddddmmmm////mmmmeeeessssssssaaaaggggeeeessss for more informa-
     tion about the SCSI configuration of your machine.

     Each _t_r_a_c_k corresponds to a single file  that  contains  the
     prepared data for that track.  If the argument is `----', stan-
     dard input is used for that track. There  may  only  be  one
     track that is taken from _s_t_d_i_n.

          The CD-Recorder  will  go  through  all  steps  of  the
          recording  process,  but the laser is turned off during
          this procedure.  It is recommended to run several tests
          before  actually writing to a Compact Disk, if the tim-
          ing and load response of the system is not known.

          Allow multi session CD's to be made. This flag needs to
          be  present  on  all  sessions of a multi session disk,
          except you want to create a session that  will  be  the
          last  session  on the media.  The fixation will be done
          in a way that allows the CD-Recorder  to  append  addi-
          tional sessions later. This is done by generation a TOC
          with a link to the next program area. The so  generated
          media is not 100%  compatible to manufactured CD's. Use
          only for recording a multi session CD.  If this  option
          is present, the default track type is CCCCDDDD----RRRROOOOMMMM XXXXAAAA mmmmooooddddeeee 2222.

     ----ffffiiiixxxx  The disk will only be fixated (i.e. a TOC  for  a  CD-

          Do not fixate the disk after writing the  tracks.  This
          may be used to create an audio disk in steps. An unfix-
          ated disk can usually not be used on  a  non  CD-writer
          type  drive but there are audio CD players that will be
          able to play such a disk.

          Eject disk after doing the work.   Some  Devices  (e.g.
          Philips) need to eject the medium before creating a new

          real disk would not work on these devices.

          Set the speed factor of the writing process to #.  # is
          an integer, representing a multiple of the audio speed.
          This is about 150 KB/s for CD-ROM and  about  172  KB/s
          for  CD-Audio.  If no _s_p_e_e_d option is present, ccccddddrrrreeeeccccoooorrrrdddd

          care. If a wrong driver is used for a device, the  pos-
          sibility  of  creating  corrupted  disks  is high.  The
          minimum problem related to a wrong driver is that the ----

          If this flag is present, swapped audio data may be used
          for  writing  to  CD.   Some  types  of CD-Writers e.g.
          Yamaha, Sony and the new SCSI-3/mmc  drives  are  using
          the  wrong byte order for audio data, ignoring the fact
          that the SCSI-protocol otherwise correctly uses network
          (big  endian)  byte  order.  CCCCddddrrrreeeeccccoooorrrrdddd  knows  if  a CD-

          order  of  the  data stream to the byte order described
          with the -_a_u_d_i_o flag.  You only need the -_s_w_a_b flag  if

          the  audio  data  to  be  a multiple of 2352 bytes. The

     For all examples below, it will  be  assumed  that  the  CD-
     Recorder  is  connected  to  the  primary  SCSI  bus  of the
     machine. The SCSI target id is set to 2.

     To record a pure CD-ROM at double speed, using data from the
     file _c_d_i_m_a_g_e._r_a_w:

         cdrecord -v speed=2 dev=2,0 cdimage.raw

     To create an image for a ISO 9660 filesystem with Rock Ridge
     extensions:

         mkisofs -R -o cdimage.raw /home/joerg/master/tree

     To check the resulting file before writing to CD on Solaris:

         mount -r -F fbk -o type=hsfs /dev/fbk0:cdimage.raw /mnt

     On Linux:

         mount cdimage.raw -r -t iso9660 -o loop /mnt

     Go on with:
         ls -lR /mnt
         umount /mnt

     If the overall speed of the system  is  sufficient  and  the
     structure  of  the  filesystem  is not too complex, cdrecord
     will run without creating an image of the ISO 9660  filesys-
     tem. Simply run the pipeline:

         mkisofs -R /master/tree | cdrecord -v speed=2 dev=2,0 -

     If your system is loaded, you should run mkisofs in the real
     time  class  too.   To raise the priority of mmmmkkkkiiiissssooooffffssss replace
     the command

         mkisofs -R /master/tree
     by
         priocntl -e -c RT -p 59 mkisofs -R /master/tree

     on Solaris and by

         nice -18 mkisofs -R /master/tree

     on SunOS.

     Cdrecord runs at priority 59  on  Solaris,  you  should  run
     mkisofs  at  no  more than priority 58. On SunOS, you should
     run mkisofs at no less than nice -18.

     Creating a CD-ROM without file system image on disk has been

     work up to double speed.  A faster machine may  be  able  to
     handle quad speed also.

     To check if it will be ok to use double speed for the  exam-

     The minimal size of a track is 4 seconds or 300 sectors.  If
     you  write  smaller  tracks,  the CD-Recorder will add dummy

     seem to have problems to use them with speed=2, try  speed=0

     The Yamaha CDR-400 and all new SCSI-3/mmc conforming  drives
     are  supported  in  single  and multi-session.  CD-RW drives
     like the Ricoh  MP-6200  are  currently  supported  as  CD-R

     added in a later version of cdrecord.

     Never give write permissions  for  non  root  users  to  the
