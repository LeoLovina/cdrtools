     CCCCddddrrrreeeeccccoooorrrrdddd is used to record data or audio Compact Discs on an
     Orange Book CD-Recorder.

     The _d_e_v_i_c_e refers to _s_c_s_i_b_u_s/_t_a_r_g_e_t/_l_u_n of the  CD-Recorder.
     Communication  on _S_u_n_O_S is done with the SCSI general driver
     ssssccccgggg.... Other operating systems are using a library  simulation
     of    this    driver.     Possible    syntax    is:     ddddeeeevvvv====
     _s_c_s_i_b_u_s,_t_a_r_g_e_t,_l_u_n or ddddeeeevvvv==== _t_a_r_g_e_t,_l_u_n.  In the latter  case,
     the  CD-Recorder has to be connected to the default SCSI bus
     of  the  machine.   _S_c_s_i_b_u_s,  _t_a_r_g_e_t  and  _l_u_n  are  integer
     numbers.  Some operating systems or SCSI transport implemen-
     tations may require to specify a filename in  addition.   In
     this  case  the  corect  syntax  for  the  device  is:  ddddeeeevvvv====
     _d_e_v_i_c_e_n_a_m_e:_s_c_s_i_b_u_s,_t_a_r_g_e_t,  or  ddddeeeevvvv====  _d_e_v_i_c_e_n_a_m_e:_t_a_r_g_e_t,_l_u_n.
     If  the  name  of the device node that has been specified on
     such a system referres to exactly one SCSI device, a  short-
     hand  in the form ddddeeeevvvv==== _d_e_v_i_c_e_n_a_m_e:@ or ddddeeeevvvv==== _d_e_v_i_c_e_n_a_m_e:@,_l_u_n
     may be used instead of ddddeeeevvvv==== _d_e_v_i_c_e_n_a_m_e:_s_c_s_i_b_u_s,_t_a_r_g_e_t,


     To make ccccddddrrrreeeeccccoooorrrrdddd portable to all UNIX platforms, the  syntax
     ddddeeeevvvv====  _d_e_v_i_c_e_n_a_m_e:_s_c_s_i_b_u_s,_t_a_r_g_e_t, is preferred as is hides OS
     specific knowledge about device  names  from  the  user.   A
     specific  OS must not necessarily support a way to specify a
     real   device   file   name   nor   a   way    to    specify
     _s_c_s_i_b_u_s,_t_a_r_g_e_t,_l_u_n.


     _S_c_s_i_b_u_s 0 is the default SCSI bus on the machine. Watch  the
     boot   messages   for   more   information   or   look  into
     ////vvvvaaaarrrr////aaaaddddmmmm////mmmmeeeessssssssaaaaggggeeeessss for more information about the SCSI confi-
     guration  of  your  machine.  If you have problems to figure
     out what values for _s_c_s_i_b_u_s,_t_a_r_g_e_t,_l_u_n should be  used,  try
     the ----ssssccccaaaannnnbbbbuuuussss option of ccccddddrrrreeeeccccoooorrrrdddd described below.


     If a file /etc/default/cdrecord exists, the parameter to the
     ddddeeeevvvv==== option may also be a drive name label in said file (see
     FILES section).


     On SSSSVVVVrrrr4444 compliant systems, ccccddddrrrreeeeccccoooorrrrdddd uses the the  real  time

          Allow multi session CD's to be made. This flag needs to
          be  present  on  all  sessions of a multi session disk,
          except you want to create a session that  will  be  the
          last  session  on the media.  The fixation will be done
          in a way that allows the CD-Recorder  to  append  addi-
          tional sessions later. This is done by generation a TOC
          with a link to the next program area. The so  generated
          media  is  not  100%  compatible  to  manufactured CD's
          (except for CDplus). Use only for  recording  of  multi

     Note that you may need to  specify  bbbbllllaaaannnnkkkk====_a_l_l  because  some
     drives  will  not  continue  with certain types of bad CD-RW
     disks. Note also that ccccddddeeeeccccoooorrrrdddd does it's best if the  ---- ffffoooorrrrcccceeee
     flag  is used but it finally depends on the drive's firmware
     whether the blanking operation will succeed or not.

     ffffssss====# Set the fifo (ring buffer) size to #.  You may use  the
          same method as in dddddddd(1), ssssdddddddd(1) or ssssttttaaaarrrr(1).  The number
          representing the size is taken in bytes  unless  other-
          wise  specified.   If  a number is followed directly by
          the letter `b', `k', `m', `s' of `f', the size is  mul-
          tiplied  by 512, 1024, 1024*1024, 2048 or 2352.  If the
          size consists of numbers separated by `x' or `*',  mul-
          tiplication  of  the  two  numbers  is performed.  Thus
          _f_s=_1_0_x_6_3_k will specify a fifo size of 630 kBytes.

          The size specified by the  _f_s=  argument  includes  the
          shared  memory  that is needed for administration. This
          is at least one page of memory.  If no  _f_s=  option  is
          present,  ccccddddrrrreeeeccccoooorrrrdddd  will try to get the fifo size value

          size is currently 4 MB.

          The fifo is used to increase  buffering  for  the  real
          time  writing  process.   It  allows to run a pipe from
          mmmmkkkkiiiissssooooffffssss directly into ccccddddrrrreeeeccccoooorrrrdddd.  If the fifo is  active
          and a pipe from mmmmkkkkiiiissssooooffffssss into ccccddddrrrreeeeccccoooorrrrdddd is used to create
          a CD, ccccddddrrrreeeeccccoooorrrrdddd will abort prior to do any modifications
          on  the  disk if mmmmkkkkiiiissssooooffffssss dies before it starts writing.
          The recommended fifo size is between 4 and  32  MBytes.
          As  a  rule  of thumb, the fifo size should be at least
          equal to the size of the internal  buffer  of  the  CD-
          Recorder  and  no more than half of the physical amount
          of RAM available in the machine.  If the fifo  size  is
          big enough, the fifo statistics will print a fifo empty
          count of zero and the fifo min fill is not  below  20%.
          It  is  not wise to use too much space for the fifo. If
          you need more than 8 MB  to  write  a  CD  on  an  idle
          machine,  your  machine  is  either  underpowered,  has
          hardware problems  or  is  mis-configured.   The  sun4c
          architecture  (e.g. a Sparcstation-2) has only MMU page
          table entries for 16 MBytes  per  process.  Using  more
          than  14  MBytes  for  the fifo may cause the operating
          system in this case to spend much  time  to  constantly
          reload  the  MMU tables. Newer machines from Sun do not
          have this MMU hardware problem. I have  no  information
          on PC-hardware reflecting this problem.

          If you have buffer underruns or  similar  problems  and
          observe  a  zero  _f_i_f_o  _e_m_p_t_y  _c_o_u_n_t, you have hardware
          problems. The fifo size in this case is sufficient.

          Sets the SCSI target for  the  CD-Recorder,  see  notes
          above.  A typical device specification is ddddeeeevvvv====_6,_0 .  If
          a filename must be provided together with the numerical
          target  specification,  the  filename is implementation
          specific.  The correct filename in  this  case  can  be
          found  in  the  system  specific  manuals of the target
          operating system.  On a _F_r_e_e_B_S_D system without _C_A_M sup-
          port,   you  need  to  use  the  control  device  (e.g.
          /_d_e_v/_r_c_d_0._c_t_l).  A correct device specification in this
          case may be ddddeeeevvvv====/_d_e_v/_r_c_d_0._c_t_l:@ .

          On Linux, drives connected to a parallel  port  adapter
          are  mapped  to  a virtual SCSI bus. Different adapters
          are mapped to different targets on  this  virtual  SCSI
          bus.

          fails  due  to  a  timeout,  you  may  try to raise the
          default SCSI command timeout above the timeout value of

          or  a  Microsoft  .WAV file and extracts the audio data
          from the files by skipping over  the  non-audio  header
          information.   In  all  other cases, cdrecord will only
          work correctly if the audio data stream does  not  have
          any header.  Because many structured audio files do not
          have an integral number of blocks  (1/75th  second)  in
          length,  it  is  often  necessary  to  specify the ----ppppaaaadddd
          option as well.  ccccddddrrrreeeeccccoooorrrrdddd recognizes that audio data in
          a  .WAV  file  is  stored in Intel (little-endian) byte
          order, and will automatically byte-swap the data if the
          CD  recorder  requires  big-endian  data. CCCCddddrrrreeeeccccoooorrrrdddd will
          reject any audio file that does not match the Red  Book
          requirements  of 16-bit stereo samples in PCM coding at
          44100 samples/second.

          is the structure described above (raw pcm data in  big-
          endian  byte  order).   However,  if  the  data  format
          includes a header, you will hear a click at  the  start

          If this flag is present, audio data is assumed to be in
          byte-swapped  (little-endian) order.  Some types of CD-
          Writers e.g. Yamaha, Sony and the new SCSI-3/mmc drives
          require  audio  data  to  be presented in little-endian
          order, while other writers require  audio  data  to  be
          presented  in  the big-endian (network) byte order nor-

          order, and corrects the byte order of the  data  stream
          to match the needs of the recorder.  You only need the
          -_s_w_a_b flag if your data stream  is  in  Intel  (little-

     For all examples below, it will  be  assumed  that  the  CD-
     Recorder  is  connected  to  the  primary  SCSI  bus  of the
     machine. The SCSI target id is set to 2.

     To record a pure CD-ROM at double speed, using data from the
     file _c_d_i_m_a_g_e._r_a_w:

         cdrecord -v speed=2 dev=2,0 cdimage.raw

     To create an image for a ISO 9660 filesystem with Rock Ridge
     extensions:

         mkisofs -R -o cdimage.raw /home/joerg/master/tree

     To check the resulting file before writing to CD on Solaris:

         mount -r -F fbk -o type=hsfs /dev/fbk0:cdimage.raw /mnt

     On Linux:

         mount cdimage.raw -r -t iso9660 -o loop /mnt

     Go on with:
         ls -lR /mnt
         umount /mnt

     If the overall speed of the system  is  sufficient  and  the
     structure  of  the  filesystem  is not too complex, cdrecord
     will run without creating an image of the ISO 9660  filesys-
     tem. Simply run the pipeline:

         mkisofs -R /master/tree |  cdrecord  - v  fs=6m  speed=2
     dev=2,0 -

     The recommended minimum fifo size for running this  pipeline
     is  4  MBytes.   As  the  default fifo size is 4 MB, the ffffssss====
     option needs only be present if you want to use a  different
     fifo size.  If your system is loaded, you should run mkisofs
     in the real time  class  too.   To  raise  the  priority  of
     mmmmkkkkiiiissssooooffffssss replace the command

     Cdrecord runs at priority 59  on  Solaris,  you  should  run
     mkisofs  at  no more than priority 58. On other systems, you
     should run mkisofs at no less than nice --18.

     Creating a CD-ROM without file system image on disk has been
     tested  on  a  Sparcstation-2  with a Yamaha CDR-400. It did
     work up to quad speed when the machine was  not  loaded.   A
     faster  machine may be able to handle quad speed also in the
     loaded case.

     To record a pure CD-DA (audio) at single  speed,  with  each
     track   contained   in   a   file   named   _t_r_a_c_k_0_1._c_d_a_u_d_i_o,
     _t_r_a_c_k_0_2._c_d_a_u_d_i_o, etc:

         cdrecord -v speed=1 dev=2,0 -audio track*.cdaudio

     To check if it will be ok to use double speed for the  exam-
     ple above. Use the dummy write option:

         cdrecord -v -dummy speed=2 dev=2,0 -audio track*.cdaudio

     To record a mixed-mode CD with an ISO 9660  filesystem  from
     _c_d_i_m_a_g_e._r_a_w on the first track, the other tracks being audio
     tracks from the files _t_r_a_c_k_0_1._c_d_a_u_d_i_o, _t_r_a_c_k_0_2._c_d_a_u_d_i_o, etc:

         cdrecord  - v  - dummy  dev=2,0   cdimage.raw   -  audio
     track*.cdaudio

     To handle drives that need to  know  the  size  of  a  track
     before starting to write, first run

         mkisofs -R -q -print-size /master/tree

     and then run

         mkisofs  -R  /master/tree  |  cdrecord  speed=2  dev=2,0

          Any other label
               is an identifier for a specific drive on the  sys-

               acters ',', '/', '@' or ':'.

               Each line that follows  a  label  contains  a  TAB
               separates  list  of items.  Currently, three items
               are recognized: the SCSI  ID  of  the  drive,  the

               and the default FIFO size that should be used  for
               this  drive. The values for _s_p_e_e_d and _f_i_f_o_s_i_z_e may
               be set to -1 to tell cdrecord to  use  the  global
               defaults.  A typical line may look this way:

     be read in all CD players. Some old audio CD players however
     may produce a two second click between two audio tracks.

     The minimal size of a track is 4 seconds or 300 sectors.  If
     you  write  smaller  tracks,  the CD-Recorder will add dummy
     blocks. This is not an error,  even  though  the  SCSI-error
     message looks this way.

     CCCCddddrrrreeeeccccoooorrrrdddd has been tested  on  an  upgraded  Philips  CDD-521
     recorder at single and double speed on a SparcStation 20/502
     with no problems, slower computer systems should work  also.
     The  newer  Philips/HP/Plasmon/Grundig  drives  as  well  as
     Yamaha CDR-100 and CDR-102 work also.  The  Plasmon  RF-4100
     work,  but  has not tested in multi session.  A Philips CDD-
     521 that has not been upgraded  will  not  work.   The  Sony
     CDU-924  has  been  tested, but does not support XA-mode2 in
     hardware.  The sony therefore cannot create conforming multi
     session  disks.   The  Ricoh RO-1420C works, but some people
     seem to have problems to use them with speed=2, try  speed=0
     in this case.

     The Yamaha CDR-400 and all new SCSI-3/mmc conforming  drives
     are supported in single and multi-session.

     You should run several tests in all supported speeds of your
     drive  with  the   ---- dddduuuummmmmmmmyyyy option turned on if you are using
     ccccddddrrrreeeeccccoooorrrrdddd on an unknown system. Writing a CD  is  a  realtime
     process.  NNNNFFFFSSSS  will not always deliver constantly the needed
     data rates.  If you want to use ccccddddrrrreeeeccccoooorrrrdddd with CD-images that
     are  located  on  a NNNNFFFFSSSS mounted filesystem, be sure that the
     fifo size is big enough.  I used ccccddddrrrreeeeccccoooorrrrdddd with  with  medium
     load   on   a   SS20/502   and  even  at  quad  speed  on  a
     Sparcstation-2 which was heavily loaded, but  it  is  recom-
     mended  to  leave  the  system as lightly loaded as possible
     while writing a CD.  If you want to make  sure  that  buffer
     underrungs  are  not caused by your source disk, you may use
     the command

     A Compact Disc can have no more than 99 tracks.

     When creating a disc with both audio and  data  tracks,  the
     data  should  be  on  track  1 otherwise you should create a
     CDplus disk which is a multi session  disk  with  the  first
     session  containing  the audio tracks and the following ses-
     sion containing the data track.

     Many operating systems are not able to read more than a sin-
     gle data track, or need special software to do so.

CDRECORD(1)          Schily's USER COMMANDS           CDRECORD(1)



     The Philips CDD 521 CD-Recorder (even in the  upgraded  ver-
     sion) has several firmware bugs. Some of them will force you
     to power cycle the device or to reboot the machine.

     When using ccccddddrrrreeeeccccoooorrrrdddd  with  the  broken  LLLLiiiinnnnuuuuxxxx  SSSSCCCCSSSSIIII  ggggeeeennnneeeerrrriiiicccc
     ddddrrrriiiivvvveeeerrrr....  You  should  note  that  ccccddddrrrreeeeccccoooorrrrdddd uses a hack, that
     tries to  emulate  the  functionality  of  the  scg  driver.
     Unfortunately,  the  sg  driver  on LLLLiiiinnnnuuuuxxxx has several severe
     bugs:

     +o     It cannot see if a SCSI command could not be  sent  at
          all.

     +o     It cannot get the SCSI status byte. CCCCddddrrrreeeeccccoooorrrrdddd for  that
          reason  cannot  report  failing  SCSI  commands in some
          situations.

     +o     It cannot get real DMA  count  of  transfer.  CCCCddddrrrreeeeccccoooorrrrdddd
          cannot tell you if there is an DMA residual count.

     +o     It cannot get number of  bytes  valid  in  auto  sense
          data.   CCCCddddrrrreeeeccccoooorrrrdddd cannot tell you if device transfers no
          sense data at all.

      +o     It  fetches  to  few  data  in  auto  request   sense
          (CCS/SCSI-2/SCSI-3 needs >= 18).

     The fifo percent output is computed just after  a  block  of
     data  has  been written to the CD-Recorder. For this reason,
     there will never be 100% fifo fill, while  the  fifo  is  in
     streaming mode.

     You have 9 seconds to type ^C to abort  ccccddddrrrreeeeccccoooorrrrdddd  after  you
     see the message:

     Starting to write CD at speed %d in %s mode for %s session.

     A typical error message for a SCSI command looks like:

          cdrecord: I/O error. test unit ready: scsi sendcmd: no error
          CDB:  00 20 00 00 00 00
          status: 0x2 (CHECK CONDITION)
          Sense Bytes: 70 00 05 00 00 00 00 0A 00 00 00 00 25 00 00 00 00 00

          Sense Code: 0x25 Qual 0x00 (logical unit not supported) Fru 0x0
          Sense flags: Blk 0 (not valid)

     The first line gives information about the transport of  the
     command.   The  text  after  the first colon gives the error
     text for the system call from the view  of  the  kernel.  It

     usually  is:   IIII////OOOO  eeeerrrrrrrroooorrrr  unless other problems happen. The
     next words contain a short description for the SCSI  command
     that fails. The rest of the line tells you if there were any
     problems for the transport of the command over the SCSI bus.
     ffffaaaattttaaaallll  eeeerrrrrrrroooorrrr means that it was not possible to transport the
     command (i.e.  no  device  present  at  the  requested  SCSI
     address).

     The second line prints the SCSI command descriptor block for
     the failed command.

     The third line gives information on  the  SCSI  status  code
     returned  by  the  command,  if the transport of the command
     succeeds. This is error information from the SCSI device.

     The fourth line is a hex dump  of  the  auto  request  sense
     information for the command.

     The fifth line is the error text for the sense key if avail-
     able,  followed  by the segment number that is only valid if
     the command was a _c_o_p_y command. If the error message is  not
     directly  related  to the current command, the text _d_e_f_e_r_r_e_d
     _e_r_r_o_r is appended.

     The sixth line is the error text for the sense code and  the
     sense  qualifier if available.  If the type of the device is
     known, the sense data is decoded from tables in _s_c_s_i_e_r_r_s._c .
     The text is followed by the error value for a field replace-
     able unit.

     The seventh line prints the block number that is related  to
     the  failed  command  and  text for several error flags. The
     block number may not be valid.

     The following message is not an error:
          Track 01: Total bytes read/written: 2048/2048 (1 sectors).
          cdrecord: I/O error. flush cache: scsi sendcmd: no error
          CDB:  35 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
          status: 0x2 (CHECK CONDITION)
          Sense Bytes: F0 00 05 80 00 00 27 0A 00 00 00 00 B5 00 00 00 00 00
          Sense Key: 0x5 Illegal Request, Segment 0
          Sense Code: 0xB5 Qual 0x00 (dummy data blocks added) Fru 0x0
          Sense flags: Blk -2147483609 (valid)

     It simply notifies, that a track that is  smaller  than  the
     minimum size has been expanded to 300 sectors.
