     ddddeeeevvvvdddduuuummmmpppp is a crude utility to interactively display the con-
     tents of device or filesystem images.  The initial screen is
     a display of the first 256 bytes of the first 2048 byte sec-
     tor.  The commands are the same as with iiiissssoooodddduuuummmmpppp.

     iiiissssoooodddduuuummmmpppp is a crude utility to interactively display the con-
     tents  of  iso9660  images  in  order  to  verify  directory
     integrity.  The initial screen is a  display  of  the  first
     part  of  the  root  directory, and the prompt shows you the
     extent number and offset in the extent.

          You can use the 'a' and 'b' commands to move  backwards
          and  forwards  within the image. The 'g' command allows
          you to goto an arbitrary extent, and  the  'f'  command
          specifies  a  search string to be used. The '+' command
          searches forward for the next instance  of  the  search
          string, and the 'q' command exits ddddeeeevvvvdddduuuummmmpppp or iiiissssoooodddduuuummmmpppp.

     iiiissssooooiiiinnnnffffoooo is a utility to perform directory like  listings  of
     iso9660 images.

     iiiissssoooovvvvffffyyyy is a utility to verify the integrity  of  an  iso9660
     image.  Most  of  the  tests in iiiissssoooovvvvffffyyyy were added after bugs
     were discovered in early versions of mmmmkkkkiiiissssooooffffssss.... It  isn't  all
     that  clear  how useful this is anymore, but it doesn't hurt
     to have this around.

     These utilities are really quick hacks, which are very  use-
     ful  for  debugging  problems  in  mkisofs  or in an iso9660
     filesystem. In the long run, it would be nice to have a dae-
     mon that would NFS export a iso9660 image.

     The isoinfo program is probably the program that is  of  the
     most use to the general user.

     These utilities come with the mkisofs package, and the  pri-
     mary       ftp      site      is      tsx-11.mit.edu      in
     /pub/linux/BETA/cdrom/mkisofs and many other  mirror  sites.
     Despite the name, the software is not beta.
