     mmmmkkkkiiiissssooooffffssss is effectively a pre-mastering program  to  generate
     the  iso9660  filesystem  -  it  takes a snapshot of a given
     directory tree, and generates  a  binary  image  which  will
     correspond  to an iso9660 filesystem when written to a block
     device.

     mmmmkkkkiiiissssooooffffssss is also capable of generating the System Use Sharing
     Protocol  records  specified  by  the Rock Ridge Interchange
     Protocol.  This is used to further describe the files in the
     iso9660  filesystem to a unix host, and provides information
     such as longer filenames, uid/gid,  posix  permissions,  and
     block and character devices.

     Each file written to the  iso9660  filesystem  must  have  a
     filename  in the 8.3 format (8 characters, period, 3 charac-
     ters, all upper case), even if Rock Ridge is in  use.   This
     filename is used on systems that are not able to make use of
     the  Rock  Ridge  extensions  (such  as  MS-DOS),  and  each
     filename  in each directory must be different from the other
     filenames in the same directory.  mmmmkkkkiiiissssooooffffssss generally tries to
     form  correct  names  by  forcing the unix filename to upper
     case and truncating as required, but often times this yields
     unsatisfactory  results when there are cases where the trun-
     cated names are not all unique.  mmmmkkkkiiiissssooooffffssss assigns  weightings

     to  each  filename,  and if two names that are otherwise the
     same are found the name with the lower priority  is  renamed
     to  have  a 3 digit number as an extension (where the number
     is guaranteed to be unique).  An example of  this  would  be
     the  files  foo.bar  and  foo.bar.~1~ - the file foo.bar.~1~
     would be written as FOO.000;1 and the file foo.bar would  be
     written as FOO.BAR;1

     Note that mmmmkkkkiiiissssooooffffssss is not designed to  communicate  with  the
     writer directly.  Most writers have proprietary command sets
     which vary from one manufacturer to another, and you need  a
     specialized  tool  to  actually  burn the disk.  The ccccddddwwwwrrrriiiitttteeee
     utility is one such tool that runs under Linux and  performs
     this task.  The latest version of ccccddddwwwwrrrriiiitttteeee is capable of com-
     municating with the Phillips/IMS/Kodak, HP and Yamaha drives
     that  have been manufactured before 1997.  Most writers come
     with some version of DOS software that allows a direct image
     copy of an iso9660 image to the writer.  The current version
     of         ccccddddwwwwrrrriiiitttteeee         is         available         from
     ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/utils/disk-management/cdwrite-
     2.0.tar.gz Note that cdwrite has  not  been  actively  main-
     tained since 1995.

     The ccccddddrrrreeeeccccoooorrrrdddd utility is another utility capable  of  burning
     an actual disc.  The latest version of ccccddddrrrreeeeccccoooorrrrdddd is available
     from  ftp://ftp.fokus.gmd.de/pub/unix/cdrecord  Cdrecord  is
     under constant development.

     Also you should know that most cd writers are very  particu-
     lar about timing.  Once you start to burn a disc, you cannot
     let their buffer empty before you are done, or you will  end
     up  with  a  corrupt  disc.  Thus it is critical that you be
     able to maintain an uninterrupted data stream to the  writer
     for the entire time that the disc is being written.

     ppppaaaatttthhhhssssppppeeeecccc is the path of the directory tree to be copied into
     the  iso9660  filesystem.   Multiple paths can be specified,
     and mmmmkkkkiiiissssooooffffssss will merge the files found in all of the  speci-
     fied path components to form the cdrom image.

     It is possible to graft the paths at points other  than  the
     root  directory, and it is possible to graft files or direc-
     tories onto the cdrom image with names different  than  what
     they  have  in  the  source  filesystem.  This is easiest to
     illustrate with a  couple  of  examples.    Let's  start  by
     assuming  that  a local file ../old.lis exists, and you wish
     to include it in the cdrom image.


          foo/bar/=../old.lis

     will  include  the  file  old.lis  in  the  cdrom  image  at

     /foo/bar/old.lis, while

          foo/bar/xxx=../old.lis

     will  include  the  file  old.lis  in  the  cdrom  image  at
     /foo/bar/xxx.   The  same  sort  of  syntax can be used with
     directories as well.  mmmmkkkkiiiissssooooffffssss will  create  any  directories
     required such that the graft points exist on the cdrom image
     - the directories do not need to appear in one of the paths.
     Any  directories  that are created on the fly like this will
     have permissions 0555 and appear to be owned by  the  person
     running mkisofs.  If you wish other permissions or owners of
     the intermediate directories, the  easiest  solution  is  to
     create  real  directories  in  the  path  such  that mkisofs
     doesn't have to invent them.

     mmmmkkkkiiiissssooooffffssss will also run on Win9X/NT4  machines  when  compiled

          This  option  is required to make a bootable CD for Sun
          sparc systems.  If the ----BBBB or  ---- ssssppppaaaarrrrcccc----bbbbooooooootttt  option  has
          been specified, the first sector of the resulting image

          fies  slice  0  for  the  iso9660 image and slice 1 ...
          slice 7 for the boot images that  have  been  specified
          with  this option. Byte offset 512 ... 8191 within each
          of the additional boot images must  contain  a  primary
          boot that works for the appropriate sparc architecture.
          The rest of each of the images usually contains an  ufs
          filesystem that is used primary kernel boot stage.

          The implemented boot method is the  boot  method  found
          with  SunOS  4.x  and  SunOS 5.x.  However, it does not
          depend on SunOS internals but only on properties of the
          Open  Boot  prom.  For this reason, it should be usable
          for any OS that boots off a sparc system.

          If the special filename ............ is used, the actual and all

     ----mmmm _g_l_o_b
          Exclude _g_l_o_b from being written to CDROM.   _g_l_o_b  is  a
          shell  wild-card-style  pattern that must match part of
          the filename (not the path as with option ----xxxx).  Techni-
          cally _g_l_o_b is matched against the _d->_d__n_a_m_e part of the
          directory  entry.   Multiple  globs  may  be  excluded.
          Example:

          mkisofs -o rom -m '*.o' -m core -m foobar

          would exclude all files ending in ".o",  called  "core"
          or "foobar" to be copied to CDROM. Note that if you had
          a directory called "foobar" it too (and of  course  all
          its descendants) would be excluded.

          NOTE: The -m and -x option description should  both  be
          updated,  they  are wrong.  Both now work identical and
          use filename globbing. A file is excluded if either the
          last component matches or the whole path matches.

          forces  the  ----NNNN option as the extra name space is taken
          from the space reserved for ISO-9660 version numbers.
          This violates the ISO9660 standard, but it  happens  to
          work  on  many systems.  Although a conforming applica-
          tion needs to provide a buffer space  of  at  least  37
          characters,  disks created with this option may cause a
          buffer overflow in the reading  operating  system.  Use

          The  output  of  mmmmkkkkiiiissssooooffffssss  will  be  a new session which
          should get written to the end of the image specified in
          - M.   Typically this requires multi-session capability
          for the recorder and cdrom drive that you are  attempt-
          ing  to  write  this image to.  This option may only be
          used in conjunction with the ----CCCC option.

     ----NNNN    Omit version numbers from ISO9660 file names.
          This violates the ISO9660 standard, but no  one  really

          name  of  the  optical  disc writer.  If not specified,
          stdout is used.  Note that the output  can  also  be  a

          The padding is neded as many  operating  systems  (e.g.
          Linux)  implement  read  ahead bugs in their filesystem
          I/O. These bugs result in read errors on  one  or  more
          files  that are located at the end of a track. They are
          usually present when the CD is written in Track at Once
          mode or when the disk is written as mixed mode CD where
          an audio track follows the data track.

          The option ----uuuusssseeee----ffffiiiilllleeeevvvveeeerrrrssssiiiioooonnnn allows mkisofs to use  file
          version  numbers from the filesystem.  If the option is
          not specified, _m_k_i_s_o_f_s creates a version if 1  for  all
          files.   File  versions  are strings in the range ;_1 to
          ;_3_2_7_6_7 This option is the default on VMS.

     ----UUUU    Allows "Untranslated" filenames, completely  violating
          the  iso9660 standards described above. Forces on the -
          d, -l, -L, -N and - no-iso-translate  flags,  and  also
          allows  more than one '.' character in the filename, as
          well as mixed case filenames.  This is useful on  HP-UX
          system,  where  the  built-in  CDFS filesystem does not
          recognize ANY extensions. Use with extreme caution.

          Do not translate the characters '#' and '~'  which  are
          invalid  for  iso9660  filenames.  These characters are
          though invalid often used by Microsoft systems.
          This violates the ISO9660 standard, but it  happens  to
          work on many systems.  Use with caution.

     ----VVVV _v_o_l_i_d
          Specifies the volume ID (volume name or  label)  to  be
          written into the master block.  This parameter can also
          be set in the file ....mmmmkkkkiiiissssooooffffssssrrrrcccc with VOLI=id.  If  speci-
          fied  in both places, the command line version is used.
          Note that if you assign a volume ID, this is  the  name
          that  will  be  used  as  the  mount  point used by the
          Solaris volume management system and the name  that  is
          assigned to the disc on a Windows or Mac platform.

          Exclude _p_a_t_h from being written to CDROM.  _p_a_t_h must be
          the  complete  pathname that results from concatenating
          the pathname given as command  line  argument  and  the
          path relative to this directory.  Multiple paths may be
          excluded.  Example:

          mkisofs -o cd -x /local/dir1 -x /local/dir2 /local

          NOTE: The -m and -x option description should  both  be
          updated,  they  are wrong.  Both now work identical and
          use filename globbing. A file is excluded if either the

          an experimental feature, and no hosts yet support this,
          but there are ALPHA patches for Linux that can make use
          of this feature.

     modify the boot file specified by the ----bbbb option by inserting
     a 56-byte "boot information table" at offset 8 in the  file.
     This  modification is done in the source filesystem, so make
     sure you use a copy if this file is  not  easily  recreated!
     This file contains pointers which may not be easily or reli-
     ably obtained at boot time.

     The format of this table is as follows; all integers are  in
     section 7.3.1 ("little endian") format.

       Offset    Name           Size      Meaning
        8        bi_pvd         4 bytes   LBA of primary volume descriptor
       12        bi_file        4 bytes   LBA of boot file
       16        bi_length      4 bytes   Boot file length in bytes

       24        bi_reserved    40 bytes  Reserved

     The 32-bit checksum is the sum of all the  32-bit  words  in
     the  boot file starting at byte offset 64.  All linear block
     addresses (LBAs) are given  in  CD  sectors  (normally  2048
     bytes).
