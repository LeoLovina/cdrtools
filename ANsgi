A first release of cdrecord has been released for SGI.

SGI has a userland SCSI ioctl(2) that is very similar to my /dev/scg* design
that I made in 1986 for SunOS/Solaris. I am using my SCSI library, you don't 
need to link the program with -lds

This cdrecord distribution contains a hacked mkisofs-1.11 that runs on SGI
and allows you th read a filesystem from a CD-R device with 2048 bytes 
sector size. This is done with the SCSI user level library.

I would be happy to get test reports ...
