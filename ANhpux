A first release of cdrecord has been released for HP-UX.

HP-UX has a userland SCSI ioctl(2) that is very similar to my /dev/scg* design
that I made in 1986 for SunOS/Solaris.

Note that there are no device nodes for userland SCSI on HP-UX,
you have to call the included shell script MKNOD.hpux first.

This cdrecord distribution contains a mkisofs release that runs on HP-UX
and allows you to read a filesystem from a CD-R device with 2048 bytes 
sector size regardless if it identifies as CD-ROM or WORM. 
This is done with the SCSI user level library.

I would be happy to get test reports ...

To compile with the free K&R C-compiler call:

	gmake CCOM=cc 'COPTS= ' 
or
	smake CCOM=cc 'COPTS= '
