NEW features of cdrtools-2.00.3:

Please have a look at the German open Source Center BerliOS at www.berlios.de
BerliOS will continue to support free hosting of cryptography projects even
when US laws change and don't allow to host cryptography projects in the USA.
Also look at sourcewell.berlios.de, the first Open Source announcement service
that itself is implemented as Open Source project.

All:

NOTE:	This is a security and portability security uptate to fix a possible
	root exploit if cdrecord or other libscg users are installed suid root.

If you like to get a fixed mkisofs (e.g. correct Rock Ridge handling) you should
upgrade to 2.01a15 or newer.


-	Support for the ELF format in BSDi 4.x

-	Allow floating point printing on OS/2. This has been possible
	since 11/2001 but OS/2 has been forgotten.

-	Correct OS/2 ranlib handling

-	New architecture 9000-831-hp

-	Include +DAportable in HP-UX cc options

-	README.hpux enhanced to include hints on how to compile 64 bit
	binaries.

-	Support for NetBSD on PPC (macppc-netbsd-cc)

-	portable getdomainname() replacement now supports to get the domainname
	from /etc/resolv.conf. This allows usage even on OS/2

-	Typo in DEFAULTS files fixed

-	New generic target for symlinks

-	New file rename.c for portability part of libschily

-	Better Next STep support:

	-	Some workarounds for broken unistd.h

	-	-lkvm removed from Next Step config.

	-	waitdefs.h fixed for very old BSD based systems (~ 1980)
		like Next STep

	-	strdup() moved into portablility part of libschily

	-	fixed typo in fctldefs.h R_RDONLY -> O_RDONLY

	-	New file ttydefs.h includes portability phrases from ved and bsh.

	-	Added an autoconf test for buggy termios.h in Next Step.
		Next STep provides fully fuctional termios.h but tcgetattt(), ...
		is missing in libc.

	-	Test for clock_t changed to deal with a bug in Next STep.
		Next Step illegally needs sys/time.h for clock_t

-	Change autoconf/statdefs.h to support nanosecond support for SCO
	UnixWare and FreeBSD

-	Call conf/mkdep-sco.sh via sh to be independant from 'x' bit.

-	libschily/rename.c fixed for SCO Openserver fo avoid warning
	for redefinition of MAXPATHNAME

-	libschily/usleep.c fixed to avoid SCO Openserver warning about
	non matching prototype in system include files

-	Better Portability for SCO UnixWare

	-	New platfoms i486, i586, Pentium III, Prntium Pro

	-	Let strdefs.h also include strings.h for strcasecmp()

	-	Support for missing struct sockaddr_storage

	-	Support for froken wait3() (returns wrong timings)

	-	Changed broken portability Prototype support in libfile
		to use 'makefiles / prototype.h' based system

	-	Changed fileopen() and filereopen() to avoid fdopen()
		problems (does not accept mode string that does not
		match fd flags)
