This Version 1.0 of cdrecord for Solaris

Cdrecord allows you to create CD's on a CD-Recorder.
Cdrecord runs on Solaris 2.3 or later.

The cdrecord distribution contains a SCSI user level transport library.
The SCSI library is suitable to talk to any SCSI device without having
a special driver for it.


You need the SCSI generic driver 'scg' in order to run cdrecord.

The 'scg' driver is Copyright 1986-1995 Jörg Schilling,
it is supplied binary in pkgadd(1m) format and is tested 
on Solaris 2.3 & Solaris 2.4.


It is nice to have the 'fbk' driver to mount files that contain
images of file systems. Fbk means File simulates Block Device.

The 'fbk' driver is Copyright 1988-1995 Jörg Schilling,
it is supplied binary in pkgadd(1m) format and is tested
on Solaris 2.3 & Solaris 2.4.

If scg & fbk compile on Solarix x86, they will be released within the next
days.
cdrecord should compile on SunOS, but you will need the scg driver for
SunOS in this case.


Cdrecord for Solaris is tested on a Philips CDD 521.
It should run also on:

	Philips CDD 522
	Philips CDD 2000
	HP C4324/C4325
	HP SureStore 4020i
	Plasmon CDR 4220
	Grundig CDR-100
(not tested)

Implemented but not tested at all:
	Yamaha CDR-100
	Yamaha CDR-102

To install get:

	SCHILYscg.sparc.tar.Z	The scg driver in pkgadd format (sparc).
	SCHILYfbk.sparc.tar.Z	The fbk driver in pkgadd format (sparc).
	cdrecord.tar.Z		The cdrecord for Solaris distribution.

NOTE:	These tar archives are 100% ansi compatible. Solaris 2.x tar and GNU
	tar may get some minor trouble.

The files are located on:

ftp://ftp.fokus.gmd.de/pub/unix/cdrecord/...
ftp://ftp.fokus.gmd.de/pub/unix/kernel/scg/...
ftp://ftp.fokus.gmd.de/pub/unix/kernel/fbk/...

Installation Process:

	1) scg driver
			untar SCHILYscg.tar:
			su
			Password: xxxxx
			cd /tmp
			zcat SCHILYscg.tar | tar -xvf -
			cd SCHILYscg
			pkgadd -d .
			reboot -- -r 

	2) fbk driver
			similar to scg driver (see above)

	3) Switch the CD-Writer to an unused target id (2 should do it)
		

NOTE:
	You need to be root because you need access to /dev/scg? and to be
	able to put cdrecord into the realtime scheduling class.


The SCSI transport library has been taken from the sformat program.
