This is Version 1.4 of cdrecord for Solaris/Linux

Cdrecord allows you to create CD's on a CD-Recorder.
Cdrecord runs on:

SunOS 4.1.3 or later:	sparc.
Solaris 2.3 or later:	sparc and x86.
Linux:			x86 sparc and alpha.

For multi session please read README.multi

Cdrecord runs without problems on a loded Solaris system.
On SunOS and Linux you have to test.

Cdrecord has been designed with a similar user interface as cdwrite
written by
	Adam J. Richter <adam@yggdrasil.com>
now maintained by
	H. Peter Anvin <hpa@transmeta.com>

The cdrecord distribution contains a SCSI user level transport library.
The SCSI library is suitable to talk to any SCSI device without having
a special driver for it.
Cdrecord may be easily ported to any system that has a 
SCSI device driver similar to the scg driver.

On Linux cdrecord currently uses the /dev/sg? driver 
	- you need no additional driver

On SunOS/Solaris:
You *need* the SCSI general driver 'scg' in order to run cdrecord.

Solaris only:
The 'scg' driver is Copyright 1986-1995 Jörg Schilling,
it is supplied binary in pkgadd(1m) format and is tested 
on Solaris 2.3, Solaris 2.4 & Solaris 2.5 (sparc).

Solaris only:
It is _nice to have_ the 'fbk' driver to mount files that contain 
images of file systems. Fbk means File simulates Block Device.

The 'fbk' driver is Copyright 1988-1995 Jörg Schilling,
it is supplied binary in pkgadd(1m) format and is tested
on Solaris 2.3, Solaris 2.4 & Solaris 2.5 (sparc).

cdrecord compiles and runs on Solaris x86, thanks to 
gert@fwi.uva.nl (Gert Poletiek) who did the tests.
The bitorder problems have been eliminated.

Cdrecord-1.3 or later adopts the right BUF_SIZE for each architecture.

cdrecord should compile on SunOS, but you will need the scg driver for
SunOS in this case.


Cdrecord has been implemented with a Philips CDD 521.
Cdrecord now is maintained with a Philips CDD-2000
It should run also on:

	Philips CDD 522
	Philips CDD 2000
	Philips CDD 2600
	HP C4324/C4325	 (HP SureStore 4020i/6020i)
	Plasmon	RF-41000
	Plasmon CDR 4220 (not tested)
	Grundig CDR-100  (not tested)
	Mitsumi	CR-2401-TS (not tested)
	Yamaha	CDR-100
	Yamaha	CDR-102
	Sony	CDU-924

Multi-session has not been tested with the Plasmon RF-4100

All companies that support me with SCSI command reference manuals and drives
will get (continued) support in the following releases.

To install get:

Solaris only:
	SCHILYscg.sparc.tar.Z	The scg driver in pkgadd format (sparc).
	SCHILYfbk.sparc.tar.Z	The fbk driver in pkgadd format (sparc).
	SCHILYscg.i386.tar.Z	The scg driver in pkgadd format (x86).
	SCHILYfbk.i386.tar.Z	The fbk driver in pkgadd format (x86).

All Systems:
	cdrecord-1.4.tar.gz	The cdrecord for source distribution.

NOTE:	These tar archives are 100% ansi compatible. Solaris 2.x tar and GNU
	tar may get some minor trouble.

The files are located on:

ftp://ftp.fokus.gmd.de/pub/unix/cdrecord/ ...
ftp://ftp.fokus.gmd.de/pub/unix/kernel/scg/ ...
ftp://ftp.fokus.gmd.de/pub/unix/kernel/fbk/ ...

If you need mkisofs, it is located on:

ftp://ftp.fokus.gmd.de/pub/unix/cdrecord/mkisofs-1.11.tar.gz

but it is also contained in cdrecord-1.4



Installation Process:

Solaris only:
	1) scg driver
			untar SCHILYscg.tar:
			su
			Password: xxxxx
			cd /tmp
			zcat SCHILYscg.tar | tar -xvf -
			pkgadd -d .
			reboot -- -r 

	2) fbk driver
			similar to scg driver (see above)

	3) Switch the CD-Writer to an unused target id (2 should do it)
		

NOTE:
	Be very carefull. pkgadd does not check for the right target 
	architecture. Do not indstall drivers for intel on sparc
	and vice versa. You will get a corrupt system.

	You need to be root because you need access to /dev/scg? and to be
	able to put cdrecord into the realtime scheduling class.

All Systems:

The SCSI transport library has been taken from the sformat program.
Sformat is the first SCSI disk formatting/analyzing/repairing that runs on
SunOS/Solaris. The first release of sformat has been made for SunOS 3.0
(two years before Sun introduced their format utility). Sformat source
including 10 years of competence in SCSI disk handling will be 
available within the next few months.

I am interested to hear if someone is interested in a kernel based
filesystem for Solaris that uses packet writing on the CD-Recorder.
The filesystem will create a single session CD that may be finally converted
to a hybride filesystem that alllows to be read as 
ISO-9660 with Rock Ridge extensions too.
