This is Version 1.1 of cdrecord for Solaris

Cdrecord allows you to create CD's on a CD-Recorder.
Cdrecord runs on sparc and x86 on Solaris 2.3 or later.
Cdrecord runs without problems on a loded system.

The cdrecord distribution contains a SCSI user level transport library.
The SCSI library is suitable to talk to any SCSI device without having
a special driver for it.
Cdrecord may be easily ported to any system that has a 
SCSI device driver similar to the scg driver.


You *need* the SCSI general driver 'scg' in order to run cdrecord.

The 'scg' driver is Copyright 1986-1995 Jörg Schilling,
it is supplied binary in pkgadd(1m) format and is tested 
on Solaris 2.3, Solaris 2.4 & Solaris 2.5 (sparc).


It is _nice to have_ the 'fbk' driver to mount files that contain 
images of file systems. Fbk means File simulates Block Device.

The 'fbk' driver is Copyright 1988-1995 Jörg Schilling,
it is supplied binary in pkgadd(1m) format and is tested
on Solaris 2.3, Solaris 2.4 & Solaris 2.5 (sparc).

cdrecord compiles and runs on Solaris x86, thanks to 
gert@fwi.uva.nl (Gert Poletiek) who did the tests.
The bitorder problems have been eliminated.

cdrecord should compile on SunOS, but you will need the scg driver for
SunOS in this case.


Cdrecord has been implemented with a Philips CDD 521.
It should run also on:

	Philips CDD 522
	Philips CDD 2000
	HP C4324/C4325	 (HP SureStore 4020i)
	Plasmon CDR 4220 (not tested)
	Grundig CDR-100  (not tested)
	Yamaha CDR-100
	Yamaha CDR-102

It definitely does (currently) not run on a Plasmon RF-41000
which has the same drive mechanism as the Philips CDD-522 but a different
SCSI interface board.

I currently have SCSI command reference manuals for:
	
	Philips CDD-522
	Philips CDD-2000
	HP C4324/C4325	 (HP SureStore 4020i)
	Plasmon	RF-41000			*1
	Sony	CDU-924				*2
	Yamaha	CDR-100/102

*1	Will get support if there is someone willing to test form me
*2	Will get support within the next weeks.

All companies that support me with SCSI command reference manuals and drives
will get (continued) support in the following releases.

To install get:

	SCHILYscg.sparc.tar.Z	The scg driver in pkgadd format (sparc).
	SCHILYfbk.sparc.tar.Z	The fbk driver in pkgadd format (sparc).
	SCHILYscg.i386.tar.Z	The scg driver in pkgadd format (x86).
	SCHILYfbk.i386.tar.Z	The fbk driver in pkgadd format (x86).
	cdrecord-1.1.tar.Z	The cdrecord for Solaris distribution.

NOTE:	These tar archives are 100% ansi compatible. Solaris 2.x tar and GNU
	tar may get some minor trouble.

The files are located on:

ftp://ftp.fokus.gmd.de/pub/unix/cdrecord/ ...
ftp://ftp.fokus.gmd.de/pub/unix/kernel/scg/ ...
ftp://ftp.fokus.gmd.de/pub/unix/kernel/fbk/ ...

Installation Process:

	1) scg driver
			untar SCHILYscg.tar:
			su
			Password: xxxxx
			cd /tmp
			zcat SCHILYscg.tar | tar -xvf -
			pkgadd -d .
			reboot -- -r 

	2) fbk driver
			similar to scg driver (see above)

	3) Switch the CD-Writer to an unused target id (2 should do it)
		

NOTE:
	Be very carefull. pkgadd does not check for the right target 
	architecture. Do not indstall drivers for intel on sparc
	and vice versa. You will get a corrupt system.

	You need to be root because you need access to /dev/scg? and to be
	able to put cdrecord into the realtime scheduling class.


The SCSI transport library has been taken from the sformat program.
Sformat is the first SCSI disk formatting/analyzing/repairing that runs on
SunOS/Solaris. The first release of sformat has been made for SunOS 3.0
(two years before Sun introduced their format utility). Sformat source
including 10 years of competence in SCSI disk handling will be 
available within the next few months.

I am interested to hear if someone is interested in a kernel based
filesystem for Solaris that uses packet writing on the CD-Recorder.
The filesystem will create a single session CD that may be finally converted
to a hybride filesystem that alllows to be read as 
ISO-9660 with Rock Ridge extensions too.
Please mail suggestions to: wofs@schily.isdn.cs.tu-berlin.de
