There may be some performance problems on Solaris x86.
A possible solution is to reduce BUF_SIZE to 32 kBytes.
It may be that the real reason is that the PC-architecture
has no IO-MMU and therefore is not able to do DVMA.
If this points out to be the reason, I have to
change the scg driver & cdrecord, but this would 
be neded on Linux anyway.
