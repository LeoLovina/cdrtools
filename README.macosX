Unfortunately, Apple does not deliver a consistent Mac OS-X system

The file <bsd/dev/scsireg.h> tries to include <kern/queue.h> which cannot
be found.

To be able to compile, I suggest to create a symlink:

System/Library/Frameworks/System.framework/Versions/B/Headers/kern -> kernserv

To do this, chdir to:

System/Library/Frameworks/System.framework/Versions/B/Headers/

and call 

ln -s kernserv kern

as root.
