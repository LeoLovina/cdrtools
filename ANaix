A first release of cdrecord has been released for AIX.

AIX has a userland SCSI ioctl(2) but unfortunately no SCSI userland device
node interface.

This cdrecord distribution contains a hacked mkisofs-1.12.1 that runs on AIX
and allows you to read a filesystem from a CD-R device with 2048 bytes 
if AIX does not support 2048 Bytes/sector (I don' know). This is done 
with the SCSI user level library.

The current implementation status is alpha. It currenly only handles
/dev/rcd* devices. No real generic SCSI support.
I got a donation from 
	Michael Staats <michael@thp.Uni-Duisburg.DE>
&	Fred Hucht <fred@thp.Uni-Duisburg.DE>

that I hope to integrate in the near future.

To make a decent release, I need access to a recent AIX
system. I currenly only have non-root access to an old system without man
pages, so I cannot test. To include error handling, I need to know some things
abount what is happening on special error situations.

To compile with the AIX cc use ./Gmake or smake from my makefiles 
distribution.

To compile with the AIX cc use ./Gmake CCOM=gcc or smake CCOM=gcc 
from my makefiles distribution.

NOTE:	AIX seems to have a kernel bug in the mmap() part
	that may cause kernel panics.

If you observe this kernel panic, try to add a line:

COPTS += -DUSE_SHM

to the file cdrecord/Makefile

It seems that SVrx style shared memory does not have this bug

I would be happy to get test reports ...
