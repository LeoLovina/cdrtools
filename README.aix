There is currently a problem with the macros isinf()/isnan()
on AIX. To go around this problem do:

setenv COPTX -DNO_FLOATINGPOINT

before calling the make program.

NOTE:	AIX seems to have a kernel bug in the mmap() part
	that may cause kernel panics.

If you observe this kernel panic, try to add a line:

COPTS += -DUSE_SHM

to the file cdrecord/Makefile

It seems that SVrx style shared memory does not have this bug
